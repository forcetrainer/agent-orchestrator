# Story 9.6: End-to-End Validation and Documentation

**Epic:** 9 - Simplify Workflow Execution Architecture
**Status:** Ready for Review
**Priority:** High
**Estimated Effort:** 13 points (2-3 days)
**Version:** 0.1
**Date Created:** 2025-10-12

---

## Story

**As a** developer
**I want** to validate that all workflows produce identical outputs with the new architecture and document the refactored patterns
**So that** we confirm Epic 9 refactor is successful, stable, and properly documented for future development

---

## Context

**Problem:**
Epic 9 has completed a major architectural refactor of the workflow execution system:
- Story 9.1: Removed execute_workflow tool (640 lines removed)
- Story 9.2: Simplified path resolver from 471 to ~150 lines
- Story 9.3: Added LLM orchestration instructions to system prompt
- Story 9.4: Implemented smart workflow pre-loading system

Before marking Epic 9 complete and proceeding to Epic 7 (Docker Deployment), we must validate:
1. All workflows function identically to pre-refactor baseline
2. No performance regressions introduced
3. Architecture documentation reflects new patterns
4. Codebase is clean and maintainable

**Solution:**
Comprehensive end-to-end validation across multiple agent bundles, performance benchmarking, documentation updates, and code cleanup to ensure Epic 9 objectives are fully met.

**Epic 9 Architectural Changes:**
- **Removed**: execute_workflow tool - LLM now orchestrates workflow execution
- **Simplified**: Path resolver - removed multi-pass nested resolution
- **Added**: Smart workflow pre-loading - single tool call loads all files
- **Updated**: System prompt with explicit workflow orchestration instructions

---

## Prerequisites

✅ Story 9.1 Complete (execute_workflow removed)
✅ Story 9.2 Complete (path resolver simplified)
✅ Story 9.3 Complete (system prompt updated with orchestration instructions v2.4.4)
✅ Story 9.4 Complete (smart workflow pre-loading implemented)

---

## Acceptance Criteria

### AC1: Multi-Bundle Workflow Validation ✅
**Objective:** Validate workflows from at least 3 different agent bundles produce identical results to baseline

**Test Bundles:**
1. **Alex (Requirements Workflow)** - Test: `intake-integration` workflow
2. **Casey (Interview Agent)** - Test: `deep-dive-workflow` or similar
3. **Pixel (Story Builder)** - Test: `build-stories` or `create-story` workflow

**Validation Requirements:**
- [ ] Each workflow executes successfully end-to-end
- [ ] Output files created in correct session folder structure
- [ ] File contents match baseline (pre-Epic 9) outputs
- [ ] manifest.json generated with correct metadata
- [ ] Session folder naming follows convention (`{session-id}/`)
- [ ] No errors or warnings in console logs
- [ ] LLM orchestration visible in conversation (explicit tool calls)

**Success Criteria:**
- 3/3 workflows pass validation
- Output files identical (ignoring timestamps)
- All expected files present

---

### AC2: Performance Benchmarking
**Objective:** Ensure no performance regressions from Epic 9 refactor

**Metrics to Measure:**
1. **Workflow Initialization Time**
   - Pre-Epic 9 baseline: ~110 seconds (sequential file loading)
   - Story 9.4 target: <20 seconds (smart pre-loading)
   - Measure: Time from user request to workflow execution start

2. **Total Workflow Execution Time**
   - Target: ≤ +10% compared to baseline
   - Measure: End-to-end time for complete workflow

3. **Token Usage**

## Technical Design

### Validation Test Framework

#### Baseline Capture
Before running validation, capture baseline outputs from pre-Epic 9 state:

```bash
# If baseline doesn't exist, note that Epic 9 is already deployed
# Use existing workflow outputs as reference baseline

# Document baseline characteristics:
# - File paths created
# - File content checksums
# - Session folder structure
# - manifest.json format
```

#### Test Execution Flow
```typescript
// Pseudo-code for workflow validation
async function validateWorkflow(workflowName: string, agentBundle: string) {
  // 1. Execute workflow with new architecture
  const result = await executeAgent(agentBundle, `/run-workflow ${workflowName}`, []);

  // 2. Collect outputs
  const sessionFolder = result.sessionFolder;
  const outputFiles = await fs.readdir(sessionFolder);

  // 3. Validate structure
  assert(outputFiles.includes('manifest.json'), 'manifest.json missing');
  assert(sessionFolder.match(/^\/data\/agent-outputs\/[a-f0-9-]+$/), 'Invalid session folder format');

  // 4. Validate content
  for (const file of outputFiles) {
    const content = await fs.readFile(`${sessionFolder}/${file}`, 'utf-8');
    // Compare to baseline (ignoring timestamps)
    // Or validate against expected patterns
  }

  // 5. Validate manifest.json
  const manifest = JSON.parse(await fs.readFile(`${sessionFolder}/manifest.json`, 'utf-8'));
  assert(manifest.workflow_name === workflowName);
  assert(manifest.agent_bundle === agentBundle);

  return { success: true, sessionFolder, outputFiles };
}
```

#### Performance Measurement
```typescript
// Performance benchmarking
async function benchmarkWorkflow(workflowName: string) {
  const startTime = Date.now();

  // Measure initialization
  const initStart = Date.now();
  const preloadResult = await executePreloadWorkflow({ workflow_path: `...` });
  const initTime = Date.now() - initStart;

  // Measure execution
  const execStart = Date.now();
  const result = await executeWorkflow(workflowName);
  const execTime = Date.now() - execStart;

  const totalTime = Date.now() - startTime;

  // Extract token usage from API logs
  const tokenUsage = extractTokenUsage(result);

  return {
    initTime,
    execTime,
    totalTime,
    tokenUsage,
    apiCalls: result.apiCallCount
  };
}
```

# Workflow Execution Migration Guide

## Overview
Epic 9 refactored workflow execution from tool-orchestrated to LLM-orchestrated pattern.

## What Changed

### Before (Epic 2-6)
- `execute_workflow` tool handled all orchestration
- Complex 10+ field tool results
- Hidden session management
- Multi-pass path resolution

### After (Epic 9)
- LLM orchestrates via system prompt instructions
- Simple tool results (read_file, save_output, preload_workflow)
- Explicit session management
- Simplified path resolver

## Migration Impact

### For Agent Builders
- No changes required to agent bundles
- Workflows execute identically
- Benefits: More transparent execution, better debugging

### For Developers
- Workflow execution now in system-prompt.md
- Simplified path resolver (~150 lines vs 471)
- Easier to understand and maintain

## New Workflow Execution Pattern

1. User: `/run-workflow intake-integration`
2. LLM: Calls `preload_workflow` tool
3. Tool: Returns all workflow files in single response
4. LLM: Follows instructions step-by-step
5. LLM: Creates session folder explicitly
6. LLM: Saves outputs using save_output

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- LLM doesn't create session folder → Check system-prompt.md for orchestration instructions
- Files not loading → Verify preload_workflow tool registered in agenticLoop.ts
- Path resolution errors → Check simplified path resolver supports {bundle-root}, {core-root}, {project-root}

- System Prompt: `lib/agents/prompts/system-prompt.md` (lines 59-204)
- Tech Spec: `docs/tech-spec-epic-9.md`
- Path Resolver: `lib/pathResolver.ts`
```
