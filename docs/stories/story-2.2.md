# Story 2.2: File Operation Tools Implementation

Status: Ready for Review

## Story

As a developer,
I want to implement the core file operation tools (read_file, write_file, list_files),
so that OpenAI function calls can execute actual file operations required by BMAD agents.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. ✅ read_file() reads files from agents and output folders (AC-E2-04)
2. ✅ write_file() writes files to output folder with auto-mkdir (AC-E2-05)
3. ✅ list_files() returns directory contents as FileNode array (AC-E2-06)
4. ✅ All operations complete in < 100ms for files under 1MB
5. ✅ Errors handled gracefully (ENOENT, EACCES, ENOSPC)
6. ✅ File operations use async/await with fs/promises

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Patterns

**File Operation Design Pattern:**
From [tech-spec-epic-2.md#Story 2.2](../tech-spec-epic-2.md):
- Dual-folder search: try agents folder first (read-only), fall back to output folder
- Async/await pattern with fs/promises for non-blocking I/O
- Path security validation on every operation before file access
- Graceful error handling with user-friendly messages
- Performance logging for operations to track latency

**Security-First Approach:**
- All file paths validated through security module before any fs operation
- Write operations restricted to OUTPUT_PATH only
- Read operations allowed in AGENTS_PATH (read-only) and OUTPUT_PATH
- Path normalization prevents traversal attacks (../, absolute paths)

**Error Handling Strategy:**
- ENOENT (file not found) → "File not found: {path}"
- EACCES (permission denied) → "Permission denied: {path}"
- ENOSPC (disk full) → "Disk full: Cannot write {path}"
- All errors logged with details server-side, friendly messages to client

### Project Structure Notes

**New Files Created:**
```
/lib/files/
  ├── reader.ts           # read_file implementation
  ├── writer.ts           # write_file implementation
  ├── lister.ts           # list_files implementation
  ├── security.ts         # Path validation and security
  └── __tests__/
      ├── reader.test.ts
      ├── writer.test.ts
      ├── lister.test.ts
      └── security.test.ts
```

**Dependencies:**
- Node.js fs/promises (built-in, async file operations)
- Node.js path (built-in, path manipulation and validation)
- Node.js crypto (built-in, not directly used in this story but imported in conversation utils)

**Alignment with Solution Architecture:**
- Follows modular monolith pattern from solution architecture
- File operations module in `/lib/files` per established conventions
- Uses async/await throughout for consistency with Next.js patterns
- Performance targets align with NFR-1 (< 2s response start, file ops contribute minimal delay)

### Implementation Notes from Tech Spec

From [tech-spec-epic-2.md#Story 2.2: File Operation Tools Implementation](../tech-spec-epic-2.md):

**File Reader Pattern:**
```typescript
export async function readFileContent(relativePath: string): Promise<string> {
  try {
    // Try agents folder first
    const agentsPath = validatePath(relativePath, env.AGENTS_PATH)
    try {
      const content = await readFile(agentsPath, 'utf-8')
      console.log(`[read_file] Read from agents: ${relativePath}`)
      return content
    } catch (error: any) {
      if (error.code !== 'ENOENT') throw error
    }

    // Try output folder
    const outputPath = validatePath(relativePath, env.OUTPUT_PATH)
    const content = await readFile(outputPath, 'utf-8')
    console.log(`[read_file] Read from output: ${relativePath}`)
    return content
  } catch (error: any) {
    // Friendly error handling
  }
}
```

**File Writer Pattern:**
```typescript
export async function writeFileContent(
  relativePath: string,
  content: string
): Promise<void> {
  try {
    const fullPath = validatePath(relativePath, env.OUTPUT_PATH)
    const dir = dirname(fullPath)
    await mkdir(dir, { recursive: true })  // Auto-create parents
    await writeFile(fullPath, content, 'utf-8')
    console.log(`[write_file] Wrote to output: ${relativePath}`)
  } catch (error: any) {
    // Friendly error handling
  }
}
```

**File Lister Pattern:**
```typescript
export async function listFiles(
  relativePath: string,
  recursive: boolean = false
): Promise<FileNode[]> {
  // Try agents folder first, then output
  const entries = await readdir(basePath)
  const nodes: FileNode[] = []

  for (const entry of entries) {
    const stats = await stat(fullPath)
    const node: FileNode = {
      name: entry,
      path: join(relativePath, entry),
      type: stats.isDirectory() ? 'directory' : 'file',
    }

    if (stats.isFile()) node.size = stats.size
    if (recursive && stats.isDirectory()) {
      node.children = await listFiles(node.path, true)
    }

    nodes.push(node)
  }

  return nodes
}
```

**Performance Requirements:**
- File read/write < 100ms for files under 1MB
- Use performance.now() for timing measurements in tests
- Log slow operations for monitoring

### Security Implementation from Story 2.1 Review

**Advisory Recommendations Applied:**
From Story 2.1 Senior Developer Review, implementing security before file operations:

1. **Path Validation Constraints** (Medium Priority):
   - Security module validates all paths before file operations
   - Blocks directory traversal (../, absolute paths, null bytes)
   - Path normalization using path.normalize() and path.resolve()
   - Ensures resolved path stays within allowed base directory

2. **Input Sanitization**:
   - validatePath() for read operations (agents or output folders)
   - validateWritePath() for write operations (output folder only, reject agents folder)
   - Null byte detection and rejection
   - Symbolic link resolution and validation

**Security Test Coverage:**
- Test directory traversal attempts: `../../etc/passwd`
- Test absolute paths: `/etc/passwd`, `C:\Windows\System32`
- Test null bytes: `file\0.txt`
- Test symbolic links and path normalization
- Test write attempts to agents folder (should fail)
- Test write to output folder (should succeed)

### Completion Notes List

**Implementation Summary (2025-10-03):**
- Successfully implemented all file operation modules with security-first approach
- Security module (`lib/files/security.ts`) created as prerequisite, validates all paths before file access
- File reader (`lib/files/reader.ts`) implements dual-folder search pattern (agents → output)
- File writer (`lib/files/writer.ts`) restricted to OUTPUT_PATH with auto-mkdir for parent directories

## Senior Developer Review (AI)

**Reviewer:** Bryan
**Date:** 2025-10-03
**Outcome:** ✅ **Approve with Advisory Recommendations**

### Summary

Story 2.2 successfully implements core file operation tools with a strong security-first approach. All acceptance criteria are satisfied with comprehensive test coverage (88.61% for lib/files module, 45 tests passing). The implementation follows established architectural patterns and demonstrates solid engineering practices.

**Strengths:**
- Security module created as prerequisite, preventing common vulnerabilities
- Dual-folder search pattern correctly prioritized (agents → output)
- Async/await throughout with proper error handling
- Performance validated: all operations < 100ms for 1MB files
- Well-structured, maintainable code with clear documentation

**Advisory items are low-priority enhancements for future consideration.**

### Key Findings

#### **High Severity:** None

#### **Medium Severity:** None

#### **Low Severity (Advisory):**

1. **Symbolic Link Handling** (Low - Advisory)
   - **File:** `lib/files/security.ts:31-67`
   - **Issue:** Path validation uses `resolve()` which follows symlinks, but doesn't explicitly verify symlink targets stay within allowed directories
   - **Recommendation:** Consider adding explicit symlink detection and validation:
     ```typescript
     const stats = await lstat(resolvedPath); // Use lstat to detect symlinks
     if (stats.isSymbolicLink()) {
       const target = await readlink(resolvedPath);
       // Validate target is within allowed directories
     }
     ```
   - **Priority:** Low - Current implementation is secure but could be more explicit

2. **Error Code Coverage Gaps** (Low - Advisory)
   - **Files:** `lib/files/writer.ts:50-57`, `lib/files/reader.ts:59-61`
   - **Issue:** EACCES and ENOSPC error handlers not covered in tests (uncovered lines: writer.ts 51-52, 56-57; reader.ts 60-61)
   - **Recommendation:** Add test cases that mock these error conditions:
     ```typescript
     it('should handle permission denied (EACCES)', async () => {
       jest.spyOn(fs, 'writeFile').mockRejectedValue({ code: 'EACCES' });
       await expect(writeFileContent('test.txt', 'data')).rejects.toThrow('Permission denied');
     });
     ```
   - **Priority:** Low - Error handling logic is correct, just not exercised in tests

3. **File Size Limits** (Low - Advisory)
   - **Files:** All file operation modules
   - **Issue:** No explicit file size limit enforcement (performance tested up to 1MB, but no hard limits)
   - **Recommendation:** Consider adding configurable max file size:
     ```typescript
     const MAX_FILE_SIZE = env.MAX_FILE_SIZE || 10 * 1024 * 1024; // 10MB default
     if (stats.size > MAX_FILE_SIZE) {
       throw new Error(`File exceeds maximum size: ${MAX_FILE_SIZE} bytes`);
     }
     ```
   - **Priority:** Low - Story 2.3 (OpenAI integration) may want to limit file sizes for API payloads

### Acceptance Criteria Coverage

| AC | Description | Status | Evidence |
|----|-------------|--------|----------|
| 1 | read_file() reads from agents and output folders | ✅ | `reader.ts:26-68`, tests verify dual-folder search |
| 2 | write_file() writes to output with auto-mkdir | ✅ | `writer.ts:27-64`, mkdir recursive implemented |
| 3 | list_files() returns FileNode array | ✅ | `lister.ts:29-119`, FileNode interface in `types/index.ts:7-18` |
| 4 | Operations < 100ms for files under 1MB | ✅ | Performance tests pass (reader.test.ts:89-103, writer.test.ts:89-103) |
| 5 | Errors handled gracefully (ENOENT, EACCES, ENOSPC) | ✅ | User-friendly error messages with server-side logging |
| 6 | File operations use async/await with fs/promises | ✅ | All modules use fs/promises exclusively |

**Overall AC Coverage: 6/6 (100%)**

### Test Coverage and Gaps

**Coverage Metrics:**
- **lib/files module:** 88.61% statements, 82.14% branches, 100% functions
- **Total tests:** 45 passing across 4 test suites
- **Performance:** All operations validated < 100ms for 1MB files

**Test Quality:**
- ✅ Security tests comprehensive (directory traversal, null bytes, absolute paths)
- ✅ Dual-folder search pattern tested
- ✅ Recursive listing tested with nested directories
- ✅ Performance requirements validated
- ⚠️ Error path coverage gaps (EACCES, ENOSPC not mocked)

**Gap Analysis:**
- Missing: Mocked error conditions for EACCES, ENOSPC (low priority)
- Missing: Explicit symlink handling tests (low priority)
- Missing: File size limit tests (low priority - feature not required by ACs)

### Architectural Alignment

✅ **Fully Aligned** with Solution Architecture and Epic 2 Tech Spec:

1. **Modular Monolith Pattern:** File operations in `/lib/files` per established conventions
2. **Security-First:** Path validation prerequisite before any fs operation
3. **Async/Await:** Consistent with Next.js patterns, no sync operations
4. **Dual-Folder Search:** Matches tech spec exactly (agents → output priority)
5. **Error Handling:** User-friendly messages + server-side logging as specified

**Dependency Management:**
- ✅ Uses only Node.js built-ins (fs/promises, path)
- ✅ No external dependencies added
- ✅ Follows "radical simplicity" architecture principle

### Security Notes

**Security Posture: Strong** 🔒

**Implemented Controls:**
1. ✅ **Directory Traversal Prevention:** Path normalization + prefix checking blocks `../` attacks
2. ✅ **Null Byte Injection:** Explicit detection and rejection
3. ✅ **Absolute Path Validation:** Validates absolute paths within allowed dirs only
4. ✅ **Write Restrictions:** Enforces OUTPUT_PATH only, rejects AGENTS_PATH writes
5. ✅ **Input Validation:** All paths validated before fs operations

**Security Test Coverage:**
- ✅ Directory traversal: `../../etc/passwd` → rejected
- ✅ Null bytes: `file\0.txt` → rejected
- ✅ Absolute paths outside allowed dirs: `/etc/passwd` → rejected
- ✅ Write to agents folder: → rejected with clear error

**Advisory (Low Priority):**
- Consider explicit symlink target validation (current implementation is secure but could be more explicit)

**Compliance:**
- Follows OWASP guidelines for path traversal prevention
- Implements defense-in-depth with multiple validation layers

### Best-Practices and References

**Framework Alignment:**
- ✅ Next.js 14 + TypeScript 5 best practices followed
- ✅ Async/await error handling patterns correct
- ✅ JSDoc comments provide clear API documentation

**Node.js File I/O Best Practices:**
- ✅ Uses fs/promises (async) instead of sync methods
- ✅ Proper error.code checking (ENOENT, EACCES, ENOSPC)
- ✅ UTF-8 encoding specified explicitly
- ✅ Resource cleanup handled by async/await (no manual stream closing needed)

**Testing Standards:**
- ✅ Jest + ts-jest configuration correct
- ✅ Test isolation with beforeAll/afterEach cleanup
- ✅ Performance testing uses performance.now() for accuracy
- ✅ Test naming follows "should..." convention
