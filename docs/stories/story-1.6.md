## Dev Notes

### Architecture Patterns

**Modular Organization:**
- Clear separation between business logic (`lib`), UI components (`components`), API routes (`app/api`), and type definitions (`types`)
- Framework-agnostic business logic in `lib` allows for testing and potential reuse
- Components organized by feature area (chat, file-viewer, navigation, etc.)

**Clean Imports:**
```typescript
// Using index files for clean imports
import { env, handleApiError } from '@/lib/utils'
import { ApiResponse, ChatRequest } from '@/types'
```

### Project Structure Notes

**Folder Structure from Solution Architecture:**
```
agent-orchestrator/
â”œâ”€â”€ app/                    # Next.js App Router
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layout.tsx          # Root layout
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ page.tsx            # Main page
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ globals.css         # Global styles
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ api/                # API routes (defined above)
â”œâ”€â”€ components/             # React components

```

**Alignment with Solution Architecture:**
- Follows modular monolith pattern from Section 2.1
- Matches proposed source tree from Section 14
- Business logic in `lib` is framework-agnostic per Section 11.1
- Components organized by feature area per Section 11.3

### Implementation Notes from Tech Spec

From [tech-spec-epic-1.md#Story 1.6](../tech-spec-epic-1.md):

**Key Objectives:**
1. Create organized folder structure matching architecture
2. Set up index files for clean imports
3. Document structure in README
4. Ensure separation of concerns

**Index Files Pattern:**
```typescript
// lib/utils/index.ts
export * from './env'
export * from './errors'

// types/index.ts
export * from './api'
```

**README Structure:**
- Project title and description
- Folder structure diagram
- Setup instructions (install, configure, run)
- Link to solution architecture document

### Lessons from Previous Stories

From Story 1.5 Dev Agent Record:
- Keep implementations simple and focused
- Follow Next.js conventions consistently
- Use TypeScript for all files
- Export index files enable clean imports

**Alignment Note:**
- This story establishes the foundation for Epic 2 (OpenAI Integration) and Epic 3 (Chat Interface)
- Clear structure now prevents refactoring later
- Index files reduce import complexity in future stories

## Senior Developer Review (AI)

**Reviewer:** Bryan
**Date:** 2025-10-03
**Outcome:** âœ… **Approve**

### Summary

Story 1.6 successfully establishes clean project structure and organization for the Agent Orchestrator application. All seven acceptance criteria are fully satisfied with appropriate test coverage. The implementation follows Next.js 14 App Router conventions, maintains framework-agnostic business logic in `/lib`, organizes components by feature area, and provides comprehensive documentation via README.md. Tests pass (16/16), TypeScript compiles cleanly, and ESLint shows no warnings.

### Key Findings

**âœ… Strengths:**
- Clean barrel exports using index files enable simple imports (`@/lib/utils`, `@/types`)
- README.md is comprehensive with clear setup instructions, architecture overview, and development guidelines
- Test coverage appropriately validates export functionality and clean import patterns
- Component directories organized by feature (chat, file-viewer, navigation, ui, providers) not by component type
- Follows separation of concerns: `/lib` for business logic, `/components` for UI, `/types` for definitions, `/app` for routes

**ðŸ’¡ Enhancement Opportunities (Non-blocking):**
1. **[Low]** Consider adding `.gitkeep` files to empty component directories to ensure git tracks them
2. **[Low]** README could reference contribution guidelines when available
3. **[Low]** Consider adding project-level CHANGELOG.md (separate from story changelogs)

### Acceptance Criteria Coverage

| AC | Description | Status | Evidence |
|----|-------------|--------|----------|
| 1 | `/app` folder for Next.js pages and API routes | âœ… | Already exists from prior stories |
| 2 | `/lib` folder for utilities and helpers | âœ… | lib/utils/ with env.ts, errors.ts, index.ts |
| 3 | `/types` folder for TypeScript types | âœ… | types/api.ts, types/index.ts |
| 4 | `/components` folder for React components | âœ… | components/{ui,chat,file-viewer,navigation,providers} created |
| 5 | README.md with project overview and setup instructions | âœ… | README.md:1-114 (comprehensive) |
| 6 | Clear separation between frontend and backend code | âœ… | Index files enable clean imports, verified by tests |
| 7 | Folder structure documented in README | âœ… | README.md:7-34 (tree diagram) |

### Test Coverage and Gaps

**Test Coverage: Excellent**
- `lib/utils/__tests__/index.test.ts`: Validates all exports from env and errors modules, verifies `@/lib/utils` path alias works
- `types/__tests__/index.test.ts`: Validates type exports via runtime checks, verifies `@/types` path alias works
- All tests pass (16/16 total across 3 test suites)
- TypeScript compilation successful (validates type correctness)

**No Gaps Identified:** Test coverage is appropriate for an infrastructure story focused on folder structure and clean imports.

### Architectural Alignment

**âœ… Fully Aligned with Solution Architecture:**
- Follows modular monolith pattern per Section 2.1
- Matches proposed source tree from Section 14
- Business logic in `/lib` is framework-agnostic per Section 11.1
- Components organized by feature area per Section 11.3
- Clean imports via index files reduce coupling and improve maintainability

**Tech Stack Compliance:**
- Next.js 14.2.0 (App Router) âœ…
- TypeScript 5 âœ…
- Jest 30.2.0 with ts-jest âœ…
- Testing Library (React) âœ…
- ESLint with eslint-config-next âœ…

### Security Notes

**No security concerns identified.** This is an infrastructure/organizational story with no user-facing functionality, external integrations, or data handling.

### Best-Practices and References

**Next.js 14 Best Practices Applied:**
- âœ… App Router conventions followed
- âœ… TypeScript path aliases configured (`@/*` in tsconfig.json)
- âœ… Barrel exports (index files) for clean imports
- âœ… Tests co-located in `__tests__` directories

**TypeScript Best Practices:**
- âœ… Strict type checking enabled
- âœ… Type-only imports used where appropriate (types/__tests__/index.test.ts:2)

**Testing Best Practices:**
- âœ… Tests verify both compile-time (TypeScript) and runtime behavior
- âœ… Meaningful assertions with explicit expectations
- âœ… Tests are deterministic and isolated

### Action Items

**No blocking action items.** The implementation is ready for use in subsequent stories.

**Optional Enhancements (can be deferred to future stories or backlog):**
1. **[Low Priority]** Add `.gitkeep` files to empty component directories (ui, chat, file-viewer, navigation, providers) to ensure git tracks folder structure
2. **[Low Priority]** Add link to contribution guidelines in README.md when available
3. **[Low Priority]** Consider creating project-level CHANGELOG.md for tracking releases
