## Dev Notes

### Architecture Patterns and Constraints

**Reuse from Epic 4:**
- PathSecurityValidator logic from Story 4.2 (path validation, security checks)
- File operation patterns from Story 4.5 (read_file, list_files)
- Security model: read-only access to output directory only

**Integration with Story 5.1:**
- DirectoryTree renders within FileViewerPanel component
- FileViewerState.treeData stores tree structure
- Empty state (Story 5.1) replaced by tree when data loads

**Custom Tree Implementation:**
- No external tree libraries (react-arborist, react-folder-tree)
- Built with Tailwind CSS + React state management
- Recursive component pattern for nested directories

**Follow-up Enhancement (Story 5.2.1):**
- Story 5.2 provides basic directory tree with raw folder names (UUIDs)
- Story 5.2.1 adds metadata-enhanced display layer:
  - Reads manifest.json from each session folder
  - Displays human-readable names: "{Agent Title} - {Workflow Name} ({Date})"
  - Hides internal files (manifest.json) from tree display
  - Provides session metadata panel for detailed information
- Implementation note: Story 5.2 code remains unchanged, Story 5.2.1 extends tree builder and DirectoryTree component
- Migration path: Story 5.2 → Story 5.2.1 is additive (no breaking changes)

### Source Tree Components to Touch

**New Files:**
- `app/api/files/tree/route.ts` - API endpoint for directory tree
- `components/DirectoryTree.tsx` - Tree navigation component
- `lib/files/treeBuilder.ts` - Utility to build FileTreeNode hierarchy

**Modified Files:**
- `components/FileViewerPanel.tsx` - Integrate DirectoryTree, API calls
- `lib/files/pathValidator.ts` - Extend with output directory validation (if not already present)

**Test Files:**
- `components/__tests__/DirectoryTree.test.tsx`
- `app/api/files/tree/__tests__/route.test.ts`
- `lib/files/__tests__/treeBuilder.test.ts`

### Testing Standards Summary

**Unit Testing (Jest + React Testing Library):**
- DirectoryTree component: rendering, expand/collapse, click handlers
- API route: tree building, error handling, security validation
- Tree builder utility: recursive hierarchy construction

**Integration Testing:**
- FileViewerPanel + DirectoryTree + API working together
- Auto-refresh triggered by agent completion event
- Manual refresh button functionality

**Security Testing:**
- Path validator blocks access outside output directory
- Path traversal attempts return 403 Forbidden
- Reference Epic 4 security test patterns

**Performance Testing:**
- Tree with 100 files loads within 1 second (NFR-1)
- Render performance acceptable for nested structures
- No performance degradation with typical output sizes

### Project Structure Notes

**Alignment with Unified Project Structure:**
- API routes: `/app/api/files/tree/route.ts` (Next.js App Router conventions)
- Components: `/components/DirectoryTree.tsx` (PascalCase naming)
- Utilities: `/lib/files/treeBuilder.ts` (camelCase file names)
- Tests: `__tests__/` subdirectories with `.test.ts` suffix

**Data Flow:**
1. FileViewerPanel calls GET /api/files/tree
2. API reads output directory, builds FileTreeNode hierarchy
3. Response returns to frontend
4. DirectoryTree renders tree structure
5. User clicks folder → expand/collapse state toggles
6. User clicks file → selection callback to FileViewerPanel

### Completion Notes List

**Implementation Summary:**

All acceptance criteria (AC 1-7) have been successfully implemented and tested:

- **AC-1 (Directory tree displays output folder structure):** Implemented recursive tree builder (`lib/files/treeBuilder.ts`) that reads OUTPUT_PATH and constructs FileTreeNode hierarchy. API endpoint `GET /api/files/tree` returns tree structure. DirectoryTree component renders the tree with proper hierarchy.

- **AC-2 (Folders expand/collapse via click):** Implemented expand/collapse state management in DirectoryTree component using React useState. Clicking folders toggles expansion state, showing/hiding children.

- **AC-3 (Files distinguishable from folders):** Added folder icons (blue) and file icons (gray) with distinct SVG graphics. Files display size metadata (formatted in B/KB/MB). Visual distinction through icons and styling.

- **AC-4 (Nested directories with proper indentation):** Implemented depth-based indentation using inline styles (`paddingLeft: depth * 16 + 8px`). Each nesting level adds 16px of left padding, creating clear visual hierarchy.

- **AC-5 (Empty folders show as empty):** Empty directories render with `children: []` array. When expanded, they display "Empty folder" message. Empty folders are not hidden from the tree.

- **AC-6 (Tree auto-refresh after agent output):** Implemented custom event listener for `agent-response-complete` event. Added debounce logic (max 1 refresh per 2 seconds) to prevent excessive API calls. Added manual refresh button with loading indicator (animated spinning icon).

- **AC-7 (Clicking file selects it for viewing):** File click handler passes file path to `onFileSelect` callback. Selected file highlighted with `bg-blue-50` and `text-blue-700` classes.

**Architecture Decisions:**

- Reused existing `lib/files/security.ts` validatePath function for OUTPUT_PATH security validation (Epic 4 patterns)
- Custom tree implementation using Tailwind CSS + React state management (no external libraries per tech spec constraint)
- React.memo() optimization for TreeNode component to prevent unnecessary re-renders (NFR performance requirement)
- Recursive component pattern for nested directory rendering

**Test Coverage:**

- 56 tests pass for Story 5.2 implementation
- DirectoryTree component: 22 unit tests covering all ACs
- API route: 14 unit tests including security and error handling
- Tree builder utility: 15 unit tests for recursive traversal
- FileViewerPanel integration: 5 tests for API integration and error states

**Security:**

- All file paths validated through Epic 4 security module before file system access
- Path traversal attempts (../) rejected with 403 Forbidden
- Read-only access to OUTPUT_PATH only (no write operations)

**Performance:**

- Tree with 100+ files loads within 1 second (tested, meets NFR-1)
- React.memo() prevents unnecessary re-renders of tree nodes
- Async/await with fs/promises for non-blocking I/O

## Senior Developer Review (AI)

**Reviewer:** Bryan
**Date:** 2025-10-06
**Outcome:** **Approve**

### Summary

Story 5.2 implementation demonstrates strong technical execution with comprehensive test coverage (56 passing tests), proper security validation, and full compliance with all seven acceptance criteria. The code exhibits clean architecture patterns, follows Epic 4 security model correctly, and meets NFR performance requirements (tree loads <1 second for 100+ files). Implementation properly reuses existing security infrastructure and follows established coding standards.

**Recommendation:** Approve for merge with minor follow-up items documented below.

### Key Findings

**HIGH SEVERITY:** None

**MEDIUM SEVERITY:**

1. **[MEDIUM]** TypeScript strict mode violations in unrelated test files may indicate broader type safety debt (app/api/chat, components/chat, lib/openai tests have 28+ TS errors). While Story 5.2 code is clean, project-wide type safety should be addressed.

**LOW SEVERITY:**

1. **[LOW]** DirectoryTree component uses inline styles for indentation (`style={{ paddingLeft }}`) instead of Tailwind utility classes. Consider migrating to Tailwind's dynamic class generation or CSS-in-JS for consistency.

2. **[LOW]** Error handling in treeBuilder.ts uses console.warn for unreadable entries (line 74, 82) but doesn't propagate warnings to UI. Consider adding warning count to API response for transparency.

3. **[LOW]** FileViewerPanel debounce logic (lines 72-101) could be extracted into a custom React hook (`useDebounce`) for reusability and testability.

### Acceptance Criteria Coverage

| AC # | Criterion | Status | Evidence |
|------|-----------|--------|----------|
| AC-1 | Directory tree displays output folder structure | ✅ PASS | API route returns recursive tree (route.ts:36), DirectoryTree renders hierarchy (DirectoryTree.tsx:167-197), 14 API tests + 4 component tests passing |
| AC-2 | Folders expand/collapse via click | ✅ PASS | TreeNode maintains `isExpanded` state (DirectoryTree.tsx:94), click handler toggles state (line 102), 3 tests verify behavior |
| AC-3 | Files distinguishable from folders | ✅ PASS | FolderIcon (blue, line 41) vs FileIcon (gray, line 63), file size display (line 126-130), 4 tests validate icons/styling |
| AC-4 | Nested directories with proper indentation | ✅ PASS | Depth-based padding formula `depth * 16 + 8px` (line 117), recursive TreeNode rendering, 1 test verifies indentation |
| AC-5 | Empty folders show as empty | ✅ PASS | Empty children array preserved (treeBuilder.ts:79), "Empty folder" message (DirectoryTree.tsx:148-154), 3 tests cover empty scenarios |
| AC-6 | Tree auto-refresh after agent output | ✅ PASS | Event listener for `agent-response-complete` (FileViewerPanel.tsx:94), debounce logic (2s interval, line 73), manual refresh button (line 181), 2 tests verify refresh |
| AC-7 | Clicking file selects for viewing | ✅ PASS | onFileSelect callback (DirectoryTree.tsx:105), selected file highlighting (line 115), 4 tests validate selection behavior |

**Overall Coverage:** 7/7 ACs fully satisfied (100%)

### Test Coverage and Gaps

**Test Statistics:**
- **Total Tests Passing:** 56 (Story 5.2 scope)
  - DirectoryTree component: 23 tests
  - Tree builder utility: 15 tests
  - API route: 14 tests
  - FileViewerPanel integration: 4 tests (5.2-specific)
- **Test Quality:** Strong - covers happy path, edge cases, security, performance
- **Coverage Gaps Identified:** None for Story 5.2 scope

**Tested Scenarios:**
- ✅ Nested directory structures (3+ levels deep)
- ✅ Empty directories
- ✅ Large trees (100+ files performance test)
- ✅ Security: Path traversal attempts blocked
- ✅ Error handling: unreadable directories, API failures
- ✅ UI interactions: expand/collapse, file selection, refresh
- ✅ Auto-refresh debouncing

**Minor Gaps (Nice-to-Have):**
- Integration test for actual `agent-response-complete` event triggering from chat interface (relies on Epic 3 integration)
- E2E test verifying full workflow: agent creates file → tree refreshes → user selects file (Story 5.3 dependency)

### Architectural Alignment

**✅ STRENGTHS:**

1. **Epic 4 Security Model Compliance:** Correctly reuses `validatePath` from `lib/files/security.ts` (route.ts:33). Path validation enforced at API boundary before file system access. Read-only access to OUTPUT_PATH properly scoped.

2. **Tech Spec Adherence:** Custom tree implementation (no external libraries) matches tech spec constraint. FileTreeNode interface matches spec exactly (DirectoryTree.tsx:20-27 vs tech-spec-epic-5.md:302-311).

3. **Performance NFR Met:** React.memo() optimization applied (DirectoryTree.tsx:82). Performance test validates <1s load for 100+ files (meets NFR-1 requirement).

4. **Clean Component Architecture:** Proper separation of concerns (API route → tree builder → component). Recursive tree traversal correctly implemented with async/await for non-blocking I/O.

**⚠️ OBSERVATIONS:**

1. **Path Security Module Deprecation:** Code uses deprecated `lib/files/security.ts` (marked deprecated in favor of `lib/pathResolver.ts`). While functional, consider migrating to Epic 4's pathResolver for long-term consistency. **Note:** Deprecation notice states "Use lib/pathResolver.ts for new code" - this implementation was before deprecation or grandfathered in.

2. **Error Handling Strategy:** treeBuilder.ts catches and logs errors for unreadable entries (lines 72-74, 81-84) but continues building tree. This is appropriate behavior, but error visibility limited to server console logs.

### Security Notes

**✅ SECURITY STRENGTHS:**

1. **Path Traversal Protection:** All file paths validated through `validatePath` before file system access (route.ts:33). Security module blocks `../` attempts, absolute paths outside allowed directories, and null byte injection.

2. **Read-Only Access Scope:** API endpoint is GET-only (no POST/PUT/DELETE handlers). validatePath ensures all operations scoped to OUTPUT_PATH (env.OUTPUT_PATH). No write operations exposed in tree viewer.

3. **Security Test Coverage:** API route tests include explicit path traversal test cases. Security module tests validate boundary conditions (per Epic 4 patterns).

4. **Error Message Sanitization:** Security errors return generic "Access denied" messages (route.ts:59) without leaking path information.

**RECOMMENDATIONS:**

- No critical security issues identified
- Current implementation follows OWASP best practices for path traversal prevention
- Security model correctly enforced at API boundary per Epic 4 design

### Best-Practices and References

**Tech Stack Detected:**
- Next.js 14.2.0 (App Router)
- React 18
- TypeScript 5
- Jest 30.2.0 + React Testing Library 16.3.0

- ✅ React hooks used correctly (useState, useEffect, proper dependency arrays)
- ✅ TypeScript interfaces properly defined and exported
- ✅ Jest testing patterns match project standards
- ✅ Tailwind CSS utility classes used consistently

**Code Quality Observations:**
- Clean, readable code with inline AC comments mapping to requirements
- Proper error boundaries and loading states

- OWASP Path Traversal Prevention: https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Path_Traversal (patterns applied in security.ts)

### Action Items

1. **[LOW]** Refactor inline indentation styles to Tailwind dynamic classes or extract to CSS module for consistency with project styling patterns (DirectoryTree.tsx:117, 150)

2. **[LOW]** Extract debounce logic from FileViewerPanel into reusable custom hook (`lib/hooks/useDebounce.ts`) for better testability and reusability (FileViewerPanel.tsx:72-101)

3. **[LOW]** Add warning count to FileTreeResponse API contract to surface unreadable directory warnings to UI (currently silent in console logs)

4. **[MEDIUM]** Address project-wide TypeScript strict mode violations (28+ errors in chat/openai test files) to prevent type safety regression

5. **[LOW]** Add integration test verifying `agent-response-complete` event flow from chat interface to file viewer refresh (currently relies on manual testing)
