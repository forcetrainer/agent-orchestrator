# Story 6.2: File Viewer Layout Redesign (Top/Bottom Split)

Status: Done

## Story

As a user,
I want file content displayed in a wider format,
so that I can read files more easily (current narrow side panel is cramped).

## Acceptance Criteria

1. File viewer internal layout changes from left/right to top/bottom split
2. Top section (40% height): Directory tree (compact or horizontal layout)
3. Bottom section (60% height): File content display (full width of panel)
4. File content is easier to read with wider format (no horizontal scrolling for normal content)
5. Directory tree remains fully functional in top section
6. File selection in tree updates content in bottom section
7. Both sections have independent scrolling

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Task 1: Update FileViewer component layout (AC: #1, #2, #3)
  - [x] Change FileViewerPanel from horizontal to vertical split (flex-col)
  - [x] Set top section (DirectoryTree) to 40% height with overflow-y-auto
  - [x] Set bottom section (FileContent) to 60% height with overflow-y-auto
  - [x] Add border-b between sections for visual separation

- [x] Task 2: Optimize DirectoryTree for horizontal space (AC: #2, #5)
  - [x] Review existing DirectoryTree component for compact layout
  - [x] Ensure tree remains fully functional (expand/collapse, selection)
  - [x] Consider horizontal scrolling for deep nesting if needed
  - [x] Preserve all existing tree functionality (no feature regression)

- [x] Task 3: Update FileContent display (AC: #3, #4, #6)
  - [x] Verify FileContent uses full panel width (100%)
  - [x] Test with various markdown files (ensure no horizontal scroll for typical content)
  - [x] Confirm file selection in tree triggers content update
  - [x] Ensure long code blocks wrap or scroll appropriately

- [x] Task 4: Implement independent scrolling (AC: #7)
  - [x] Verify DirectoryTree scrolls independently (overflow-y-auto)
  - [x] Verify FileContent scrolls independently (overflow-y-auto)
  - [x] Test with long file lists and large file contents
  - [x] Ensure scroll position persists when switching between files

- [x] Task 5: Update tests (All ACs)
  - [x] Update FileViewerPanel tests for new layout structure
  - [x] Test DirectoryTree functionality in top section
  - [x] Test FileContent display in bottom section
  - [x] Test independent scrolling behavior
  - [x] Verify no horizontal scrolling for typical markdown content
  - [x] Test in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Patterns

**Component Structure:**
- `components/file-viewer/FileViewerPanel.tsx` - Main container with flexbox column layout
- `components/file-viewer/DirectoryTree.tsx` - File tree navigation (existing, minimal changes)
- `components/file-viewer/FileContent.tsx` - File content display (existing, minimal changes)

**Layout System:**
- Flexbox column layout for FileViewerPanel: `flex flex-col h-full`
- Top section: `h-[40%] overflow-y-auto border-b border-gray-200`
- Bottom section: `h-[60%] overflow-y-auto`
- Independent scrolling via `overflow-y-auto` on each section

**Design Rationale:**
- Top/bottom split provides wider content area (improves markdown readability)
- 40/60 ratio prioritizes content viewing over navigation
- Independent scrolling prevents scroll interference between tree and content
- Compact tree layout maximizes vertical space for file list

### Source Tree Components

Files to modify:
- `components/file-viewer/FileViewerPanel.tsx` - Change layout from horizontal to vertical split
- `components/file-viewer/__tests__/FileViewerPanel.test.tsx` - Update tests for new layout

Files to review (likely no changes needed):
- `components/file-viewer/DirectoryTree.tsx` - Verify compact layout works at 40% height
- `components/file-viewer/FileContent.tsx` - Verify full-width display

### Testing Standards

**Component Tests:**
- FileViewerPanel renders top/bottom sections with correct height ratios
- DirectoryTree functionality intact (expand/collapse, file selection)
- FileContent displays full-width without horizontal scroll
- Independent scrolling works for both sections

**Visual Regression Tests:**
- Markdown files display correctly with wider format
- Code blocks wrap or scroll appropriately
- No layout breaks with various file types
- Tree and content sections have clear visual separation

**Integration Tests:**
- Selecting file in tree updates content in bottom section
- Scroll positions independent (scrolling tree doesn't affect content)
- Works correctly when file viewer is toggled (Story 6.1)

### Project Structure Notes

**Alignment with Unified Project Structure:**
- Follows existing file-viewer component organization
- Maintains Tailwind CSS utility class patterns
- No new dependencies required (pure layout change)
- Consistent with Flexbox usage in other components

**Dependencies:**
- Requires Story 6.1 complete (toggle functionality)
- No conflicts with existing Epic 5 file viewer features
- Preserves all Story 5.2.1 session metadata display

## Senior Developer Review (AI)

**Reviewer:** Bryan
**Date:** 2025-10-07
**Outcome:** Approve with Minor Observations

### Summary

Story 6.2 successfully implements a top/bottom split layout for the file viewer, improving content readability through wider file display. The implementation demonstrates solid engineering practices with comprehensive testing, minimal code changes, and no functionality regression. All acceptance criteria are fully satisfied, and the implementation aligns with Epic 6 architectural patterns.

### Key Findings

**High Severity:** None

**Medium Severity:**
1. **[MED] React Hooks ESLint Warning** (components/FileViewerPanel.tsx:362)
   - Warning about missing dependencies in useEffect: `navigateToNextFile` and `navigateToPreviousFile`
   - Impact: Potential stale closures in keyboard navigation
   - Recommendation: Include functions in dependency array or use useCallback to memoize them
   - File/Lines: components/FileViewerPanel.tsx:362

2. **[MED] Pre-existing Build Error** (lib/tools/fileOperations.ts:121)
   - TypeScript error: Variable 'resolvedPath' used before assignment
   - Note: This is a pre-existing issue unrelated to Story 6.2, but blocks build
   - Recommendation: Address in separate bugfix story before production deployment

**Low Severity:**
1. **[LOW] Test Warnings** - React state update warnings in tests (act() wrapping)
   - Tests pass successfully but generate console warnings
   - Recommendation: Wrap state updates in act() for cleaner test output
   - Impact: Minimal - does not affect functionality

2. **[LOW] JSX Closing Tags** - Fixed missing </FileViewerProvider> tags in AgentSelector tests
   - Issue was corrected during review
   - All tests now pass

### Test Coverage and Gaps

**Excellent Test Coverage:**
- 6 new tests specifically for Story 6.2
- Total FileViewerPanel: 39/39 passing
- DirectoryTree: 37/37 passing (no regression)
- FileContentDisplay: 60/60 passing (no regression)

**Test Quality:**
- Tests verify actual DOM structure and CSS classes
- Integration tests confirm component interactions
- No flaky tests observed

**Minor Gaps:**
- Cross-browser visual regression testing not automated (manual verification required)
- Performance testing for scroll behavior not included (acceptable for this story)

### Architectural Alignment

✅ **Follows Epic 6 Tech Spec:**
- Implements exact layout pattern from docs/tech-spec-epic-6.md lines 148-163
- Uses prescribed Tailwind utilities (h-[40%], h-[60%], overflow-y-auto)
- Maintains React/Next.js patterns

✅ **Component Architecture:**
- Minimal changes preserve existing functionality
- No new dependencies introduced
- FileViewerContext integration for toggle functionality

✅ **Code Quality:**
- Clean separation of concerns
- Reuses existing components (DirectoryTree, FileContentDisplay)
- Follows project's Tailwind CSS patterns

### Security Notes

**No Security Issues Identified**

- Layout change is purely presentational
- No new data flows or API endpoints
- No user input handling changes
- File path security maintained from previous implementation
