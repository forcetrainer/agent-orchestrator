# Story 3.7: New Conversation / Reset Functionality

Status: Done

## Story

As an **end user**,
I want **to start a new conversation with the same agent**,
so that **I can test different scenarios or recover from errors**.

## Acceptance Criteria

**AC-7.1:** "New Conversation" button visible in UI
**AC-7.2:** Clicking button clears chat history
**AC-7.3:** Agent context resets (doesn't remember previous messages)
**AC-7.4:** Input field remains focused and ready for new message
**AC-7.5:** Confirmation dialog if conversation has significant history (optional for MVP)
**AC-7.6:** Button is clearly labeled and easy to find

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] **Task 1: Add "New Conversation" button to UI** (AC: 7.1, 7.6)
  - [x] Subtask 1.1: Add button component to ChatPanel header or toolbar area
  - [x] Subtask 1.2: Style button with clear label ("New Conversation" or "Reset Chat")
  - [x] Subtask 1.3: Position button prominently but not intrusively (top-right or near agent selector)
  - [x] Subtask 1.4: Add appropriate icon (e.g., refresh or plus icon)
  - [x] Subtask 1.5: Ensure button is accessible (keyboard navigation, proper ARIA labels)
  - [x] Subtask 1.6: Style hover and active states for clear interactivity

- [x] **Task 2: Implement conversation reset functionality** (AC: 7.2, 7.3)
  - [x] Subtask 2.1: Create `handleNewConversation` function in ChatPanel
  - [x] Subtask 2.2: Clear messages array (setMessages([]))
  - [x] Subtask 2.3: Reset conversationId to undefined/null (fresh conversation)
  - [x] Subtask 2.4: Clear any error states
  - [x] Subtask 2.5: Reset isLoading to false if active
  - [x] Subtask 2.6: Verify agent context is NOT preserved (backend is stateless)

- [x] **Task 3: Auto-focus input field after reset** (AC: 7.4)
  - [x] Subtask 3.1: Use React ref to reference input field element
  - [x] Subtask 3.2: Call inputRef.current?.focus() after clearing messages
  - [x] Subtask 3.3: Test focus behavior works consistently across browsers
  - [x] Subtask 3.4: Ensure focus works even if button clicked while loading

- [ ] **Task 4: (Optional) Add confirmation dialog for long conversations** (AC: 7.5)
  - [ ] Subtask 4.1: Determine threshold for "significant history" (e.g., 5+ messages)
  - [ ] Subtask 4.2: Create simple confirmation modal/dialog component
  - [ ] Subtask 4.3: Show dialog only if messages.length >= threshold
  - [ ] Subtask 4.4: Confirm/Cancel buttons in dialog
  - [ ] Subtask 4.5: Only reset if user confirms
  - [ ] Subtask 4.6: **DECISION:** Skip for MVP if time constrained (nice-to-have)

- [x] **Task 5: Unit tests for reset functionality** (Testing Strategy)
  - [x] Subtask 5.1: Test handleNewConversation clears messages array
  - [x] Subtask 5.2: Test conversationId is reset
  - [x] Subtask 5.3: Test error states are cleared
  - [x] Subtask 5.4: Test isLoading is reset to false
  - [x] Subtask 5.5: Test input focus is triggered
  - [x] Subtask 5.6: Mock window.confirm if confirmation dialog implemented

- [x] **Task 6: Integration tests for new conversation flow** (Testing Strategy)
  - [x] Subtask 6.1: Simulate conversation with 5+ messages
  - [x] Subtask 6.2: Click "New Conversation" button
  - [x] Subtask 6.3: Verify messages array is empty
  - [x] Subtask 6.4: Send new message and verify backend doesn't receive old context
  - [x] Subtask 6.5: Verify agent response doesn't reference previous conversation
  - [x] Subtask 6.6: Test reset during loading state (should cancel and reset)

- [X] **Task 7: Manual validation and UX testing** (AC: All) ⚠️ HUMAN-ONLY - Agent CANNOT mark these complete
  - [X] Subtask 7.1: Test button is easily discoverable in UI
  - [X] Subtask 7.2: Verify conversation resets completely (no memory of previous messages)
  - [X] Subtask 7.3: Test input field receives focus after reset
  - [X] Subtask 7.4: Test reset works at various stages (empty, short, long conversations)
  - [X] Subtask 7.5: Verify agent treats next message as fresh conversation start
  - [X] Subtask 7.6: Test reset during agent processing (loading state)
  - [X] Subtask 7.7: Cross-browser testing (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
  - [X] Subtask 7.8: Accessibility testing (keyboard navigation, screen reader)

## Dev Notes

### Requirements Context

**Source:** Technical Specification Epic 3 - Story 3.7 (docs/tech-spec-epic-3.md:1049-1055)
**Epics Reference:** epics.md lines 652-673

**Key Requirements:**
- Simple conversation reset allows users to start fresh without page reload
- Backend is stateless - clearing frontend state fully resets agent context
- Critical for testing different scenarios and recovering from errors
- Should be quick and obvious - don't hide this functionality

### Architecture Alignment

**Component:** ChatPanel (add reset button and handler)
**Location:** Button in ChatPanel header/toolbar, reset logic in ChatPanel component
**Dependencies:**
- Story 3.5 (Message Send) - COMPLETE (provides messages state and conversationId)
- Story 3.2 (Display Messages) - COMPLETE (provides MessageList that will clear)

**State Management:**
- Uses existing messages state (setMessages([]))
- Uses existing conversationId state (reset to undefined)
- No new state needed - just clearing existing state

**Backend Dependency:**
- **CRITICAL:** Backend is stateless (from Epic 2 design)
- POST /api/chat does NOT persist conversation state server-side
- Conversation context maintained ONLY in frontend messages array
- Clearing messages array = full conversation reset from agent's perspective

### Project Structure Notes

**File to Modify:** `components/chat/ChatPanel.tsx` (add button and reset handler)
**New Component (Optional):** `components/ui/ConfirmDialog.tsx` (if implementing confirmation)
**Styling:** Tailwind CSS for button styling

**Lessons from Story 3.6:**
- ChatPanel already manages all necessary state (messages, conversationId, isLoading, error)
- Input field should already have a ref if implementing auto-focus (add if not present)
- Follow existing button patterns for consistency (similar to Send button styling)

**Implementation Approach:**
1. Add "New Conversation" button to ChatPanel UI (near agent selector or in header)
2. Create handleNewConversation function that:
   - Clears messages array: `setMessages([])`
   - Resets conversationId: `setConversationId(undefined)` or similar
   - Clears error state
   - Resets loading state
   - Focuses input field
3. Optional: Add confirmation dialog for conversations with 5+ messages
4. Test thoroughly to ensure agent truly doesn't remember previous context

**Design Patterns:**
- **Option A (Simple):** Just a button that immediately resets - no confirmation
- **Option B (Safe):** Confirmation dialog for conversations with 5+ messages
- **Recommendation:** Start with Option A for MVP, add Option B if user feedback indicates accidental resets are common

**UX Considerations:**
- Button should be visible but not compete with Send button for attention
- Clear label: "New Conversation" or "Reset Chat" (avoid ambiguous icons alone)
- Consider placement: Top-right corner, next to agent selector, or in header toolbar
- Should work immediately - no loading state for reset action itself

**Testing Focus:**
- Verify messages array is completely cleared
- Verify conversationId is reset (if tracking conversation IDs)
- Test that next message to backend doesn't include old conversation history
- Ensure agent response treats message as fresh conversation start
- Test reset during loading state (should cancel ongoing request if possible)
