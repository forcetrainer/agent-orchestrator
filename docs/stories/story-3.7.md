# Story 3.7: New Conversation / Reset Functionality

Status: Ready for Review

## Story

As an **end user**,
I want **to start a new conversation with the same agent**,
so that **I can test different scenarios or recover from errors**.

## Acceptance Criteria

**AC-7.1:** "New Conversation" button visible in UI
**AC-7.2:** Clicking button clears chat history
**AC-7.3:** Agent context resets (doesn't remember previous messages)
**AC-7.4:** Input field remains focused and ready for new message
**AC-7.5:** Confirmation dialog if conversation has significant history (optional for MVP)
**AC-7.6:** Button is clearly labeled and easy to find

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] **Task 1: Add "New Conversation" button to UI** (AC: 7.1, 7.6)
  - [x] Subtask 1.1: Add button component to ChatPanel header or toolbar area
  - [x] Subtask 1.2: Style button with clear label ("New Conversation" or "Reset Chat")
  - [x] Subtask 1.3: Position button prominently but not intrusively (top-right or near agent selector)
  - [x] Subtask 1.4: Add appropriate icon (e.g., refresh or plus icon)
  - [x] Subtask 1.5: Ensure button is accessible (keyboard navigation, proper ARIA labels)
  - [x] Subtask 1.6: Style hover and active states for clear interactivity

- [x] **Task 2: Implement conversation reset functionality** (AC: 7.2, 7.3)
  - [x] Subtask 2.1: Create `handleNewConversation` function in ChatPanel

  - [x] Subtask 2.4: Clear any error states
  - [x] Subtask 2.5: Reset isLoading to false if active
  - [x] Subtask 2.6: Verify agent context is NOT preserved (backend is stateless)

- [x] **Task 3: Auto-focus input field after reset** (AC: 7.4)
  - [x] Subtask 3.1: Use React ref to reference input field element
  - [x] Subtask 3.2: Call inputRef.current?.focus() after clearing messages
  - [x] Subtask 3.3: Test focus behavior works consistently across browsers
  - [x] Subtask 3.4: Ensure focus works even if button clicked while loading

- [ ] **Task 4: (Optional) Add confirmation dialog for long conversations** (AC: 7.5)
  - [ ] Subtask 4.1: Determine threshold for "significant history" (e.g., 5+ messages)
  - [ ] Subtask 4.2: Create simple confirmation modal/dialog component
  - [ ] Subtask 4.3: Show dialog only if messages.length >= threshold
  - [ ] Subtask 4.4: Confirm/Cancel buttons in dialog
  - [ ] Subtask 4.5: Only reset if user confirms
  - [ ] Subtask 4.6: **DECISION:** Skip for MVP if time constrained (nice-to-have)

- [x] **Task 5: Unit tests for reset functionality** (Testing Strategy)
  - [x] Subtask 5.1: Test handleNewConversation clears messages array

  - [ ] Subtask 7.8: Accessibility testing (keyboard navigation, screen reader)

## Dev Notes

### Requirements Context

**Source:** Technical Specification Epic 3 - Story 3.7 (docs/tech-spec-epic-3.md:1049-1055)
**Epics Reference:** epics.md lines 652-673

**Key Requirements:**
- Simple conversation reset allows users to start fresh without page reload
- Backend is stateless - clearing frontend state fully resets agent context
- Critical for testing different scenarios and recovering from errors
- Should be quick and obvious - don't hide this functionality

### Architecture Alignment

**Component:** ChatPanel (add reset button and handler)
**Location:** Button in ChatPanel header/toolbar, reset logic in ChatPanel component
**Dependencies:**
- Story 3.5 (Message Send) - COMPLETE (provides messages state and conversationId)
- Story 3.2 (Display Messages) - COMPLETE (provides MessageList that will clear)

**State Management:**
- Uses existing messages state (setMessages([]))
- Uses existing conversationId state (reset to undefined)
- No new state needed - just clearing existing state

**Backend Dependency:**
- **CRITICAL:** Backend is stateless (from Epic 2 design)
- POST /api/chat does NOT persist conversation state server-side
- Conversation context maintained ONLY in frontend messages array
- Clearing messages array = full conversation reset from agent's perspective

### Project Structure Notes

**File to Modify:** `components/chat/ChatPanel.tsx` (add button and reset handler)
**New Component (Optional):** `components/ui/ConfirmDialog.tsx` (if implementing confirmation)
**Styling:** Tailwind CSS for button styling

**Lessons from Story 3.6:**
- ChatPanel already manages all necessary state (messages, conversationId, isLoading, error)
- Input field should already have a ref if implementing auto-focus (add if not present)
- Follow existing button patterns for consistency (similar to Send button styling)

**Implementation Approach:**
1. Add "New Conversation" button to ChatPanel UI (near agent selector or in header)
2. Create handleNewConversation function that:
   - Clears messages array: `setMessages([])`
   - Resets conversationId: `setConversationId(undefined)` or similar
   - Clears error state
   - Resets loading state
   - Focuses input field
3. Optional: Add confirmation dialog for conversations with 5+ messages
4. Test thoroughly to ensure agent truly doesn't remember previous context

**Design Patterns:**
- **Option A (Simple):** Just a button that immediately resets - no confirmation
- **Option B (Safe):** Confirmation dialog for conversations with 5+ messages
- **Recommendation:** Start with Option A for MVP, add Option B if user feedback indicates accidental resets are common

**UX Considerations:**
- Button should be visible but not compete with Send button for attention
- Clear label: "New Conversation" or "Reset Chat" (avoid ambiguous icons alone)
- Consider placement: Top-right corner, next to agent selector, or in header toolbar
- Should work immediately - no loading state for reset action itself

**Testing Focus:**
- Verify messages array is completely cleared
- Verify conversationId is reset (if tracking conversation IDs)
- Test that next message to backend doesn't include old conversation history
- Ensure agent response treats message as fresh conversation start
- Test reset during loading state (should cancel ongoing request if possible)

## Senior Developer Review (AI)

**Reviewer:** Bryan
**Date:** 2025-10-04
**Outcome:** ✅ **APPROVE**

### Summary

Story 3.7 implements a clean, well-tested "New Conversation" feature that allows users to reset the chat interface without page reload. The implementation satisfies all required acceptance criteria (AC-7.1 through AC-7.6) with appropriate deferral of optional AC-7.5 (confirmation dialog) per MVP guidance. Code quality is high, following React best practices, and security posture is sound. The feature integrates seamlessly with the existing architecture and introduces no regressions.

### Key Findings

**Strengths:**
- ✅ All required acceptance criteria fully satisfied with evidence in code and tests
- ✅ Clean, minimal implementation - no over-engineering
- ✅ Proper React patterns: correct use of useRef, forwardRef, and state management
- ✅ Full accessibility support: ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, focus management
- ✅ Comprehensive test coverage: 5 new tests covering happy path and edge cases
- ✅ Consistent with existing codebase patterns and architectural constraints
- ✅ Backend stateless design correctly leveraged (no server-side changes needed)

**Minor Observations (Low Priority):**
- [Low] Console.log statement in ChatPanel.tsx:71 could be removed or converted to structured logging for production
- [Low] AgentSelector button markup duplicated across loading/error/empty/normal states (could extract to helper function for DRY, but acceptable for MVP)

**No Issues Found:**
- No security concerns
- No performance issues
- No architectural violations
- No test gaps for MVP scope

### Acceptance Criteria Coverage

| AC | Requirement | Status | Evidence |
|----|-------------|--------|----------|
| AC-7.1 | "New Conversation" button visible in UI | ✅ PASS | AgentSelector.tsx:154-177 - Button rendered in header with conditional display |
| AC-7.2 | Clicking button clears chat history | ✅ PASS | ChatPanel.tsx:55 - setMessages([]) + Test: "clears messages when New Conversation button is clicked" |
| AC-7.3 | Agent context resets (no memory) | ✅ PASS | ChatPanel.tsx:58 - conversationId reset to undefined + backend stateless design |
| AC-7.4 | Input field remains focused | ✅ PASS | ChatPanel.tsx:67-69 - inputRef.current?.focus() with setTimeout for DOM update + Test: "focuses input field after reset" |
| AC-7.5 | Confirmation dialog (optional) | ⚠️ DEFERRED | Appropriately deferred per AC-7.5 "optional for MVP" guidance |
| AC-7.6 | Button clearly labeled and easy to find | ✅ PASS | "New Conversation" label + plus icon + prominent header placement + accessibility attrs |

**Verdict:** 6/6 required ACs satisfied (AC-7.5 correctly deferred as optional)

### Test Coverage and Gaps

**Test Coverage: Excellent**
- 5 new comprehensive tests added to ChatPanel.test.tsx
- Tests cover:
  - Button visibility and labeling (AC-7.1, AC-7.6)
  - Message clearing (AC-7.2)
  - Loading state reset during ongoing requests (AC-7.2 edge case)
  - Input focus behavior (AC-7.4)
  - Keyboard accessibility (AC-7.6)
- All tests passing (15/15 in ChatPanel test suite)
- No regressions introduced in full test suite (306/309 passing, 3 pre-existing failures in LoadingIndicator)

**Gaps:** None for MVP scope. Task 7 (manual validation) appropriately flagged as HUMAN-ONLY.

**Testing Best Practices:**
- ✅ Tests use React Testing Library best practices (user-event, waitFor, semantic queries)
- ✅ Edge cases covered (reset during loading, focus timing)
- ✅ Integration-level testing (full user flow simulation)

### Architectural Alignment

**Architecture Compliance: Excellent**

1. **Stateless Backend Pattern** (Tech Spec Epic 3): ✅ Correctly leveraged. Conversation context maintained in frontend only (messages array). Clearing frontend state = full reset with no backend changes required.

2. **Component Hierarchy** (Story Context): ✅ Proper prop drilling. ChatPanel owns reset handler, AgentSelector renders button, InputField exposes ref - clean separation of concerns.

3. **Existing Patterns** (Story 3.5, 3.6): ✅ Follows established state management patterns for messages, conversationId, isLoading.

4. **Constraint Adherence:**
   - ✅ selectedAgentId NOT changed on reset (per constraint in story-context-3.7.xml)
   - ✅ Previous outputs in file viewer unaffected (reset only affects chat state)
   - ✅ Tailwind CSS for styling consistency
   - ✅ TypeScript types properly maintained

**No architectural violations detected.**

### Security Notes

**Security Posture: SOUND**

- ✅ No XSS risks: React's automatic escaping used throughout
- ✅ No injection risks: Client-side state manipulation only, no server requests for reset
- ✅ No auth/authZ concerns: Feature doesn't touch authentication or authorization
- ✅ No sensitive data handling: Only clearing UI state (messages, conversationId)
- ✅ No dependency vulnerabilities introduced: No new dependencies added
- ✅ Input validation: N/A (no user input for reset action)

**Defensive Programming:**
- ✅ Optional chaining used (inputRef.current?.focus()) to prevent errors if ref not attached
- ✅ setTimeout ensures DOM updates before focus (React best practice)
- ✅ Conditional rendering (onNewConversation &&) prevents errors if callback undefined

### Best-Practices and References

**Framework Alignment:**
- **React 18 + Next.js 14:** Implementation follows React 18 best practices for refs, state updates, and event handling
- **Ref Forwarding:** Correct use of forwardRef pattern per [React docs](https://react.dev/reference/react/forwardRef)
- **Focus Management:** setTimeout(fn, 0) is an accepted pattern for post-render focus in React (ensures state flush)
- **Tailwind CSS:** Consistent use of utility classes matching existing codebase patterns

**Testing Best Practices:**
- Jest + React Testing Library patterns align with [Testing Library guiding principles](https://testing-library.com/docs/guiding-principles/)
- User-centric testing approach (testing behavior, not implementation)

**TypeScript:**
- Proper type safety maintained with forwardRef generic typing
- No type errors in production code (verified)

### Action Items

**None.** Implementation is production-ready for MVP.

**Optional Enhancements (Post-MVP):**
1. [Low Priority] Remove console.log or convert to structured logging (ChatPanel.tsx:71)
2. [Low Priority] Extract AgentSelector button markup to reusable component to reduce duplication across states
3. [Enhancement] Implement AC-7.5 confirmation dialog for long conversations (deferred from MVP, can be Story 3.7.1 if user feedback indicates accidental resets are common)

**Recommendation:** Story is ready to merge and deploy.
