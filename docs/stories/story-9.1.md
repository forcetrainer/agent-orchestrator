# Story 9.1: Remove execute_workflow Tool

Status: Ready for Review

## Story

As a **developer**,
I want to **remove the execute_workflow tool from the codebase**,
so that **LLM orchestrates workflow execution instead of hidden tool logic**.

## Context

This is the foundational story of Epic 9 "Simplify Workflow Execution Architecture". The current `execute_workflow` tool (640 lines in `lib/tools/fileOperations.ts`) does too much "magic" without LLM awareness:

- Creates session folders automatically (LLM doesn't know where)
- Generates UUIDs behind the scenes (LLM doesn't know when/why)
- Auto-loads files based on extensions (LLM doesn't request them)
- Resolves variables in 5 passes (LLM never sees the logic)
- Returns complex 10+ field objects that confuse the LLM (especially GPT-4)

**Problem**: This over-engineered approach reduces LLM agency, creates cognitive overhead, makes debugging difficult, and differs from Claude Code's proven simple file operation patterns.

**Solution**: Remove execute_workflow entirely and move session management to conversation initialization. The **hybrid approach** preserves security (system-managed UUIDs, session folders) while giving LLM explicit control (visible `{{SESSION_FOLDER}}` variable). Subsequent stories (9.2-9.5) will enable LLM to orchestrate workflows explicitly through simple `read_file` and `save_output` tools guided by system prompt instructions.

**Why This is Safe**: Epic 6 is complete and all existing workflows are functional. This story documents current behavior before removal, ensuring migration support for stories 9.2-9.5.

**Phase 2 Foundation**: This story establishes conversation-scoped sessions (one UUID per chat) that naturally extend to support conversation history persistence (PRD Phase 2 feature). The manifest.json schema can add a `messages[]` field without breaking changes.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. `lib/tools/fileOperations.ts` - Remove `executeWorkflow` function (lines 289-516)
2. `lib/tools/toolDefinitions.ts` - Remove `executeWorkflowTool` export
3. `lib/agents/agenticLoop.ts` - Remove from tool definitions list
4. Only two file operation tools remain: `read_file`, `save_output`
5. All tests referencing execute_workflow removed or updated
6. Code compiles without errors after removal
7. **Session management preserved for Phase 2 conversation history**
   - UUID generation moves to conversation start (not execute_workflow)
   - Session folder created at conversation start (in chat API route)
   - Manifest.json initialized with agent, workflow, user, timestamps
   - LLM receives `{{SESSION_ID}}` and `{{SESSION_FOLDER}}` variables in system prompt
   - save_output validates writes are within current session folder
   - **Phase 2 Ready**: Manifest schema supports adding `messages[]` field without breaking changes

## Dev Notes

### Architectural Context

**Epic 9 Goal**: Refactor workflow execution to LLM-orchestrated pattern by removing over-engineered tool abstractions.

**This Story's Role**: Remove the execute_workflow tool (640 lines) to force explicit LLM orchestration. This is intentionally destructive - workflows will not function after this story until Stories 9.2-9.5 provide the replacement architecture (simplified path resolver, system prompt instructions, updated workflow files).

**Dependencies**:
- **Prerequisites**: Epic 6 complete (✅), all workflows documented and functional
- **Blocks**: Stories 9.2-9.6 (cannot proceed until execute_workflow is removed)

### Project Structure Notes

**Files Modified**:
1. `lib/tools/fileOperations.ts` - Remove executeWorkflow function (~300 lines deleted)
2. `lib/tools/toolDefinitions.ts` - Remove executeWorkflowTool export (~30 lines deleted)
3. `lib/agents/agenticLoop.ts` - Remove from tools list (~5 lines modified)
4. `app/api/chat/route.ts` - Add session initialization at conversation start (~50 lines added)

**Security Preservation**:
- Extract and preserve security validation logic from executeWorkflow before deletion
- Security checks for path traversal, symlinks, write restrictions MUST be preserved
- These will be reused in simplified path resolver (Story 9.2)

**Session Management Preservation**:
- Extract UUID generation from execute_workflow (move to conversation initialization)
- Extract manifest.json creation from execute_workflow (move to conversation initialization)
- Session folders now created at **conversation start** (not workflow start)
- LLM receives `{{SESSION_ID}}` and `{{SESSION_FOLDER}}` as explicit variables

**Testing Impact**:
- All execute_workflow unit tests will be removed
- Integration tests that call execute_workflow will be temporarily broken (fixed in Stories 9.2-9.5)
- Security tests for file operations must continue to pass

### Alignment with unified-project-structure.md

**Expected File Locations**:
- Tool implementations: `lib/tools/fileOperations.ts` (✅ matches structure)
- Tool definitions: `lib/tools/toolDefinitions.ts` (✅ matches structure)
- Agentic loop: `lib/agents/agenticLoop.ts` (✅ matches structure)

**No structural conflicts detected** - all files align with established project structure from Epic 4.

### Testing Strategy

**Unit Tests**:
- Remove: All tests specifically for executeWorkflow function
- Update: Integration tests that indirectly rely on execute_workflow (may need mocking)
- Preserve: Security tests for read_file and save_output

**Integration Tests**:
- **EXPECTED FAILURES**: Workflow execution tests will fail after this story
- Document failing tests in completion notes
- These will be fixed in Stories 9.2-9.5 when replacement architecture is in place

**Test Validation Command**:
```bash
# Find all references to execute_workflow (should return 0 except in docs)
git grep "execute_workflow" lib/ app/

# Verify only 2 tools remain
npm test -- toolDefinitions.test.ts
```

### Risk Mitigation

**Risk**: Breaking all workflow functionality
**Mitigation**: This is intentional and expected. Epic 6 must be complete and stable before starting Epic 9. Document all broken functionality in completion notes.

**Risk**: Losing important security validation code
**Mitigation**: Extract and document security logic before deletion. Preserve in separate function for reuse in Story 9.2.

**Risk**: Incomplete removal causing subtle bugs
**Mitigation**: Comprehensive grep for "execute_workflow" in final cleanup (AC 6). Verify 0 results in source code.

### Phase 2 Readiness (Conversation History)

**Foundation Established in Story 9.1:**
- ✅ One UUID per conversation (conversation-scoped, not workflow-scoped)
- ✅ Session folder isolation (`/data/agent-outputs/{uuid}/`)
- ✅ Manifest.json with agent, workflow, user metadata
- ✅ Human-readable display names (Story 6.3 already implemented)
- ✅ Security: System-managed sessions prevent LLM from writing to wrong locations
- ✅ Simplicity: LLM uses `{{SESSION_FOLDER}}` explicitly (no magic)

**Phase 2 Extension (Out of Scope for Story 9.1):**

To enable conversation history (PRD Phase 2 - "Session persistence across browser sessions"), simply extend manifest.json:

```json
{
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "session_id": "{uuid}",
  "agent": {...},
  "workflow": {...},
  "execution": {...},
  "outputs": [...],
  "messages": [  // ← ADD THIS IN PHASE 2
    {"role": "user", "content": "...", "timestamp": "..."},
    {"role": "assistant", "content": "...", "timestamp": "..."}
  ],
  "lastAccessedAt": "2025-10-11T14:35:00Z"  // ← ADD THIS IN PHASE 2
}
```

**Phase 2 Implementation (Future):**
- Add conversation sidebar with session list (Claude.ai-style)
- Load manifest.json to restore `messages[]` array
- User clicks session → chat history restored → can continue conversation
- Auto-save messages after each LLM response
- No database, no breaking changes, file-based architecture maintained

**No architectural changes required** - Story 9.1 establishes the foundation.

## Senior Developer Review (AI)

**Reviewer**: Bryan
**Date**: 2025-10-11
**Outcome**: **APPROVE** ✅

### Summary

Story 9.1 successfully removes the over-engineered 640-line `execute_workflow` tool from the codebase, leaving only two simple file operation tools (`read_file` and `save_output`). This is the foundational story of Epic 9 "Simplify Workflow Execution Architecture" and correctly implements an intentionally destructive refactor that forces the architecture toward LLM-orchestrated workflow execution.

**Key Achievements:**
- Clean removal of executeWorkflow (339 lines deleted)
- Comprehensive documentation of removed behavior for migration support
- Security validation logic preserved in validateWritePath and executeSaveOutput
- Session management successfully moved to conversation initialization
- All 7 acceptance criteria satisfied
- Zero references to execute_workflow in source code (lib/, app/)
- TypeScript compilation successful

### Key Findings

#### Medium Priority

**1. System Prompt Update Timing** [Fixed]
- System prompt (v2.3) was updated post-implementation after runtime errors discovered
- CHANGELOG documents "Unknown function: execute_workflow" errors that occurred
- Issue was caught and fixed before review, demonstrating good QA process
- **Recommendation**: In Story 9.3, review ALL prompt files comprehensively upfront

**2. Build Fails Due to Network Issue** [Not Blocking]
- `npm run build` fails with Google Fonts network error (unrelated to Story 9.1)
- TypeScript compilation passes successfully
- **Recommendation**: Document as known infrastructure issue

#### Low Priority

**3. Pre-existing Test Type Errors** - 10 errors in components/__tests__/ (unrelated to Story 9.1)
**4. Minor ESLint Warnings** - Unescaped quotes and react-hooks deps (pre-existing)

### Acceptance Criteria Coverage

| AC # | Requirement | Status | Evidence |
|------|-------------|--------|----------|
| AC1 | Remove executeWorkflow from fileOperations.ts | ✅ PASS | Lines 289-516 deleted |
| AC2 | Remove executeWorkflowTool from toolDefinitions.ts | ✅ PASS | Only 2 tools remain |
| AC3 | Remove from agenticLoop.ts | ✅ PASS | getToolDefinitions() returns 2 tools |
| AC4 | Only two file operation tools remain | ✅ PASS | Verified in toolDefinitions.ts:72-75 |
| AC5 | All tests updated | ✅ PASS | No execute_workflow references |
| AC6 | Code compiles without errors | ✅ PASS | TypeScript compilation successful |
| AC7 | Session management preserved | ✅ PASS | createChatSession + validateWritePath working |

### Test Coverage and Gaps

**What Was Tested:**
- Comprehensive grep verification (zero results in lib/ app/)
- TypeScript compilation passes
- Security validation preserved (validateWritePath, executeSaveOutput)
- Session management working (createChatSession in app/api/chat/route.ts:74-82)
- Tool definitions correct (only 2 tools)

**Test Gaps:**
- No automated unit tests for executeWorkflow removal (acceptable - function doesn't exist)
- No integration test for conversation-scoped sessions (manual validation occurred)
- **Mitigation**: Story 9.6 will perform end-to-end validation

### Architectural Alignment

✅ **Aligns with Epic 9 Goals** - Removes over-engineered abstraction
✅ **Preserves Security Model** - All path validation/write restrictions intact
✅ **Foundation for Phase 2** - Session management correctly conversation-scoped
✅ **Follows Next.js/TypeScript Best Practices** - Clean interfaces, proper async/await, error handling

### Security Notes

✅ **No new vulnerabilities introduced**
✅ **Security validation preserved**:
- validateWritePath enforces /data/agent-outputs restriction (pathResolver.ts:147-186)
- save_output validates paths before writing (fileOperations.ts:164-184)
- Path traversal protection maintained (pathResolver.ts:459-461)
- Symlink resolution with security checks (pathResolver.ts:209-260)
✅ **Session folder security** - System-managed UUIDs prevent LLM manipulation

### Best Practices and References

- **Next.js 14.2.0**: API routes follow Next.js 14 conventions ✅
- **TypeScript 5+**: Strong typing, clear interfaces, minimal `any` usage ✅
- **Node.js File Ops**: Proper async/await, error code checking ✅
- **OWASP Security**: Input validation, path traversal prevention, whitelist restrictions ✅

- [OWASP Path Traversal](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Path_Traversal)

### Action Items

#### Epic 9 Continuation (For Stories 9.2-9.5)
1. **[Epic 9.3][Med]** When updating system prompt, review ALL prompt files comprehensively
2. **[Epic 9.6][Med]** Add automated integration tests for conversation-scoped session management
3. **[Epic 9.6][Med]** Create baseline output files from pre-Epic 9 workflows for comparison testing

#### Technical Debt / Polish (For Epic 8 or Backlog)
4. **[Epic 8][Med]** Fix pre-existing TypeScript test errors in components/__tests__/ (10 errors)
5. **[Epic 8][Low]** Address ESLint warnings for react-hooks/exhaustive-deps
6. **[Epic 8][Low]** Document Google Fonts network dependency in deployment docs

### Reviewer Comments

**Excellent execution on an intentionally destructive refactor.** This story required careful extraction of critical functionality (session management, security validation) while completely removing 640 lines of over-engineered code. The implementation:

1. **Preserves all security guarantees** - No shortcuts taken on path validation or write restrictions
2. **Documents removed behavior comprehensively** - The execute_workflow_behavior_reference.md (400+ lines) will be invaluable for Stories 9.2-9.5
3. **Maintains backward compatibility** - Session folder structure unchanged, manifest schema extensible for Phase 2
4. **Follows through on intentional destruction** - BMAD workflows will correctly fail until Stories 9.2-9.5 provide replacement architecture

The system prompt update (v2.3) being discovered post-implementation is a minor process issue but was caught and fixed before marking story "Ready for Review", demonstrating good quality practices.

**Recommendation**: ✅ **APPROVE** - Proceed with Story 9.2 (Simplify Path Resolver). This story provides a solid foundation for the rest of Epic 9.
