# Story 1.5: Basic Health Check Endpoint

Status: Done

## Story

As a developer,
I want a health check endpoint,
so that I can verify the server is running and monitor uptime.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. `/api/health` endpoint created
2. Returns 200 OK when server is healthy
3. Response includes { status: "ok", timestamp: ISO8601 }
4. Endpoint responds quickly (< 100ms)
5. Can be called without authentication
6. Used for Docker health checks later

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Create health check API route (AC: 1, 2, 3)
  - [x] Create `/app/api/health/route.ts` file
  - [x] Implement GET handler that returns 200 status
  - [x] Include status: "ok" in response body
  - [x] Include timestamp in ISO8601 format
  - [x] Add uptime and environment info to response
- [x] Configure response caching behavior (AC: 4)
  - [x] Set `dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` to disable caching
  - [x] Ensure endpoint responds in < 100ms
  - [x] Test response time with curl
- [x] Test health check endpoint (AC: 5, 6)
  - [x] Verify endpoint accessible without authentication
  - [x] Test with curl: GET http://localhost:3000/api/health
  - [x] Verify response format matches specification
  - [x] Document endpoint for future Docker healthcheck configuration

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Patterns

**Health Check Pattern:**
- Simple GET endpoint that returns server status
- No business logic - just confirms server is responding
- Includes basic server information (uptime, environment)
- Disabled caching to ensure fresh health status
- Will be used for Docker HEALTHCHECK directive in Epic 5

**Response Structure:**
```typescript
{
  status: 'ok',
  timestamp: '2025-10-03T...',
  uptime: 123.45,  // process.uptime() in seconds
  environment: 'development' | 'production'
}
```

### Project Structure Notes

**Files to Create:**
```
agent-orchestrator/
├── app/
│   └── api/
│       └── health/
│           └── route.ts           # NEW: Health check endpoint
```

**Implementation Details:**
- Use Next.js route handler pattern
- Return NextResponse.json() with health status
- Include process.uptime() for server uptime tracking
- Include process.env.NODE_ENV for environment visibility
- Set `export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` to disable caching

**Example Implementation:**
```typescript
// app/api/health/route.ts
import { NextResponse } from 'next/server'

export async function GET() {
  return NextResponse.json({
    status: 'ok',
    timestamp: new Date().toISOString(),
    uptime: process.uptime(),
    environment: process.env.NODE_ENV || 'development'
  })
}

// Disable caching for health check
export const dynamic = 'force-dynamic'
```

### Implementation Notes from Tech Spec

From [tech-spec-epic-1.md#Story 1.5](../tech-spec-epic-1.md):

**Endpoint Specification:**
- Route: `/api/health`
- Method: GET
- Response: JSON with status, timestamp, uptime, environment
- Status Code: Always 200 OK (when server is running)
- Performance: < 100ms response time
- Caching: Disabled via `dynamic = 'force-dynamic'`

**Future Usage:**
- Docker HEALTHCHECK directive (Epic 5, Story 5.6)
- Monitoring and uptime tracking
- Deployment verification (confirm server started successfully)

**Testing Approach:**
```bash
# Test with curl
curl http://localhost:3000/api/health

# Expected response:
# {"status":"ok","timestamp":"2025-10-03T...","uptime":123.45,"environment":"development"}

# Verify response time < 100ms
curl -w "@curl-format.txt" -o /dev/null -s http://localhost:3000/api/health
```

### Lessons from Previous Stories

From Story 1.4 Dev Agent Record:
- All API routes should use TypeScript types for responses
- Consider using ApiResponse wrapper for consistency
- Error handling not critical for health check (it either works or server is down)
- Keep implementation simple - no business logic

**Alignment Note:**
- Unlike other API routes, health check doesn't use error handler middleware
- Health check should NEVER throw errors - if server can respond, it's "healthy"
- No authentication check needed (public endpoint per requirements)

## Senior Developer Review (AI)

**Reviewer:** Bryan
**Date:** 2025-10-03
**Outcome:** ✅ **Approve**

### Summary

Story 1.5 implements a basic health check endpoint that meets all acceptance criteria. The implementation is clean, minimal, and follows Next.js 14 App Router conventions appropriately. The endpoint has been validated to respond in 3.6ms (well under the 100ms requirement) and is suitable for Docker HEALTHCHECK integration in Epic 5.

### Key Findings

**✓ Strengths:**
- **Correct Architecture**: Follows Next.js App Router pattern with proper async GET handler
- **Performance**: Response time of 3.6ms significantly exceeds the < 100ms requirement
- **Caching Strategy**: Properly disables caching via `dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` export
- **Simplicity**: Appropriately minimal implementation without unnecessary business logic or error handling (per design intent)
- **Type Safety**: Uses TypeScript with proper imports from Next.js

**Minor Enhancements (Optional - Low Priority):**
1. **TypeScript Response Type** (Low): Health response object could be typed for consistency with other API routes
   - Current: Inline object literal
   - Suggested: Define `HealthCheckResponse` interface in `types/api.ts`
   - *Note: Not blocking - inline typing is acceptable for simple health checks*

2. **JSDoc Documentation** (Low): Function lacks documentation comments
   - Could add brief JSDoc describing endpoint purpose and response format
   - *Note: Code is self-documenting; JSDoc would be nice-to-have*

### Acceptance Criteria Coverage

| AC # | Requirement | Status | Evidence |
|------|-------------|--------|----------|
| 1 | `/api/health` endpoint created | ✅ Pass | `app/api/health/route.ts` exists |
| 2 | Returns 200 OK when server is healthy | ✅ Pass | `NextResponse.json()` returns 200 by default |
| 3 | Response includes `{ status: "ok", timestamp: ISO8601 }` | ✅ Pass | Returns `status`, `timestamp`, `uptime`, `environment` |
| 4 | Endpoint responds quickly (< 100ms) | ✅ Pass | Validated at 3.6ms via curl timing |
| 5 | Can be called without authentication | ✅ Pass | No auth middleware, tested without credentials |
| 6 | Used for Docker health checks later | ✅ Pass | Simple 200 OK response suitable for Docker HEALTHCHECK |

### Test Coverage and Gaps

**Test Strategy Alignment:**
- ✅ Manual testing completed via curl (per Story Context line 209: "No unit tests required")
- ✅ Response format validated
- ✅ Response time validated
- ✅ Public access validated (no authentication)

**Test Coverage:** Appropriate for this story's scope. Health check endpoints typically don't require unit tests due to minimal logic. Integration tests in later epics may verify endpoint availability.

**No Gaps Identified:** Testing approach aligns with Story Context specifications.

### Architectural Alignment

**✅ Follows Project Standards:**
- Next.js 14 App Router conventions (app/api structure)
- TypeScript usage consistent with project setup
- Exports `dynamic = 'force-dynamic'` per Next.js route segment config
- File placement matches tech-spec-epic-1.md API structure

**✅ Constraint Compliance:**
- Does NOT use error handler middleware (per Story Context constraint: health check should never throw)
- No authentication check (public endpoint per requirements)
- Simple implementation without business logic (per Story Context design pattern)
- Performance requirement met (< 100ms)

**Architectural Notes:**
- Intentionally differs from other API routes by not using `handleApiError` wrapper
- This is correct per Story Context: "health check should NEVER throw errors - if server can respond, it's 'healthy'"

### Security Notes

**✅ No Security Issues Identified**

- **Public Endpoint:** Appropriately unauthenticated per requirements
- **Data Exposure:** Only exposes non-sensitive server metadata (uptime, environment, timestamp)
- **No User Input:** Zero attack surface for injection/validation issues
- **No Dependencies:** Direct Node.js/Next.js APIs only
- **Caching Disabled:** Prevents stale health status

**Security Considerations for Future:**
- Docker HEALTHCHECK (Epic 5) should use simple HTTP status check without exposing response body
- Consider rate limiting if health endpoint becomes a DoS vector (unlikely for internal Docker checks)

### Best-Practices and References

**Next.js 14 App Router:**
- ✅ Follows [Next.js Route Handlers](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/routing/route-handlers) documentation
- ✅ Uses [Route Segment Config](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/file-conventions/route-segment-config#dynamic) for `dynamic = 'force-dynamic'`
- ✅ Exports named async function `GET` per Next.js conventions

**Health Check Best Practices:**
- ✅ Returns standard HTTP 200 for healthy state
- ✅ Includes timestamp for freshness verification
- ✅ Minimal latency (3.6ms) ensures quick Docker health checks
- ✅ No external dependencies (won't fail due to downstream services)

### Action Items

**No blocking or high-priority items.** Implementation is production-ready as-is.

**Optional Enhancements (Future Consideration):**

1. **[Low] Add TypeScript response type** - `app/api/health/route.ts:4-9`
   - Define `HealthCheckResponse` interface in `types/api.ts`
   - Apply to NextResponse.json generic: `NextResponse.json<HealthCheckResponse>(...)`
   - Benefit: Consistency with other typed API routes
   - Owner: TBD (future refactoring task)

2. **[Low] Add JSDoc documentation** - `app/api/health/route.ts:3`
   - Add brief function-level JSDoc
   - Example: `/** GET /api/health - Returns server health status for monitoring and Docker health checks */`
   - Benefit: Improved developer experience when navigating codebase
   - Owner: TBD (future enhancement)

**Recommendation:** These items can be deferred to a future code quality sprint if desired. They are not critical for the current story's success.
