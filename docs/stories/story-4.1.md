# Story 4.1: Implement Agentic Execution Loop

Status: Ready for Review

## Story

As a **developer**,
I want **to implement an agentic execution loop with function calling**,
so that **agents pause execution, load files via tools, and continue only after files are available**.

## Acceptance Criteria

**AC-4.1.1:** Implement while loop that continues until LLM returns response without tool calls

**AC-4.1.2:** Each iteration follows pattern: call OpenAI → check for tool calls → execute tools → inject results → loop back to LLM

**AC-4.1.3:** Conversation messages array grows with each tool call and result, maintaining full context

**AC-4.1.4:** Tool results injected as 'tool' role messages with tool_call_id matching the tool call

**AC-4.1.5:** Loop has safety limit (MAX_ITERATIONS = 50) to prevent infinite loops

**AC-4.1.6:** Each iteration logged for debugging with iteration count and tool call information

**AC-4.1.7:** Loop maintains conversation context across all iterations (messages array preserved)

**AC-4.1.8:** Agent cannot continue without tool results - execution blocks on tool calls (no premature continuation)

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Patterns and Constraints

**Core Execution Pattern:**
The agentic loop replaces the deprecated Epic 2 simple function calling implementation. This is the foundational pattern that enables BMAD agents to work with OpenAI API.

**Key Difference from Epic 2:**
- Epic 2: Simple loop with acknowledgments (agents could continue without files)
- Epic 4: Blocking execution loop (agents MUST wait for tool results before continuing)

**Execution Flow:**
```
1. Build initial context (system + critical actions + history + user message)
2. Loop start:
   3. Call OpenAI with messages + tools
   4. Receive assistant response
   5. If tool_calls present:
      6. Execute ALL tools synchronously
      7. Inject results into messages array
      8. Go to step 3 (loop back to OpenAI)
   9. If NO tool_calls:
      10. Return final response (loop complete)
```

**Critical Implementation Notes:**
- Messages array is append-only - never remove or modify previous messages
- Each tool result MUST include matching tool_call_id from assistant's tool_calls
- Tool execution is synchronous within iteration (all tools complete before next LLM call)
- Loop termination has two conditions: (1) no tool calls OR (2) max iterations
- MAX_ITERATIONS = 50 is a safety net - normal workflows should complete in <10 iterations

### Component Locations and File Paths

**Primary Implementation:**
- `lib/agents/agenticLoop.ts` - Main execution loop (create new)

**Dependencies (from other Epic 4 stories):**
- `lib/agents/criticalActions.ts` - Critical actions processor (Story 4.3)
- `lib/agents/systemPromptBuilder.ts` - System prompt builder (Story 4.8)
- `lib/tools/fileOperations.ts` - Tool execution handlers (Story 4.5)
- `lib/pathResolver.ts` - Path variable resolution (Story 4.2)

**Integration Points:**
- Called by: `app/api/chat/route.ts` (Epic 3 Story 3.5 - refactored)
- Calls: OpenAI API via `openai` SDK
- Returns: ExecutionResult to API route for frontend response

### Testing Requirements

**Unit Tests (Required):**
1. Loop iteration logic (continues/terminates correctly)
2. Message array building and preservation
3. Tool call detection and execution triggering
4. Tool result injection format
5. Max iterations safety limit
6. Error handling and logging

**Integration Tests (Required):**
1. Full agent execution with mocked OpenAI (2-3 iterations)
2. Execution blocking behavior (verifies pause-load-continue)
3. Context preservation across iterations
4. Real workflow scenario with multiple file loads

**Test Data Needs:**
- Mock OpenAI responses with tool_calls
- Mock OpenAI responses without tool_calls (final response)
- Mock tool execution results
- Sample agent definition with critical actions

## Senior Developer Review (AI)

**Reviewer:** Bryan
**Date:** 2025-10-05
**Outcome:** **Approve with Minor Recommendations**

### Summary

Story 4.1 successfully implements the agentic execution loop with function calling per AGENT-EXECUTION-SPEC.md. The implementation correctly addresses all 8 acceptance criteria with proper blocking behavior (pause-load-continue pattern), comprehensive test coverage (25 tests: 19 unit + 6 integration), and clean architecture using stub functions for future integration points. Code quality is excellent with clear documentation, proper error handling, and no TypeScript diagnostics. All tests pass.

**Key Strengths:**
- ✅ Correct implementation of blocking execution pattern (agents pause on tool calls, wait for results)
- ✅ Excellent test coverage with realistic integration scenarios
- ✅ Well-designed stub interfaces for Stories 4.3, 4.5, 4.8 enabling parallel development
- ✅ Comprehensive logging for debugging (iteration count, tool calls, timing)
- ✅ Proper MAX_ITERATIONS=50 safety limit to prevent infinite loops

**Minor Recommendations (Non-Blocking):**
- Consider adding retry logic for transient OpenAI API failures (rate limits)
- Stub functions could benefit from TypeScript interfaces to ensure future implementations match expected contracts
- Performance monitoring could track average iterations per request for optimization insights

### Acceptance Criteria Coverage

**AC-4.1.1:** ✅ **PASS** - While loop continues until LLM returns response without tool calls
Evidence: Lines 266-362 implement while loop with proper termination on `!assistantMessage.tool_calls`. Tests verify 2-iteration and 1-iteration scenarios.

**AC-4.1.2:** ✅ **PASS** - Execution flow follows pattern: OpenAI → check tool calls → execute → inject → loop
Evidence: Lines 276-339 implement exact pattern. Integration tests verify 3-4 iteration workflows with realistic file operations.

**AC-4.1.3:** ✅ **PASS** - Messages array grows with each tool call and result
Evidence: Lines 234-255 build initial array, line 294 appends assistant messages, line 329 appends tool results. Tests verify message array growth from 3→5→7 messages.

**AC-4.1.4:** ✅ **PASS** - Tool results injected as 'tool' role with matching tool_call_id
Evidence: Lines 321-329 create tool messages with `role: 'tool'` and `tool_call_id: toolCall.id`. Tests verify correct tool_call_id matching for single and multiple tool calls.

**AC-4.1.5:** ✅ **PASS** - Loop has safety limit MAX_ITERATIONS = 50
Evidence: Line 25 defines `MAX_ITERATIONS = 50`, line 266 checks `iterations < MAX_ITERATIONS`, lines 364-369 throw error when exceeded. Test verifies exactly 50 calls before error.

**AC-4.1.6:** ✅ **PASS** - Each iteration logged with count and tool information
Evidence: Lines 271, 300, 310, 317, 335, 347 log iteration count, tool calls, tool results, and completion. Tests verify log calls with spy assertions.

**AC-4.1.7:** ✅ **PASS** - Loop maintains conversation context across iterations
Evidence: Lines 233-255 preserve conversation history, messages array never modified (append-only). Tests verify historical messages remain in final result.

**AC-4.1.8:** ✅ **PASS** - Execution blocks on tool calls (no premature continuation)
Evidence: Lines 305-339 execute all tools synchronously with `await` before `continue` on line 338. Integration test verifies execution order: LLM call 1 → tool execution → LLM call 2.

### Test Coverage and Gaps

**Unit Tests (19 tests):** ✅ Excellent
- AC coverage: All 8 ACs covered with multiple test cases each
- Edge cases: Empty tool calls, single iteration, MAX_ITERATIONS boundary, API errors, missing agent
- Message structure: Validates message roles, ordering, and tool_call_id matching

**Integration Tests (6 tests):** ✅ Excellent
- Realistic workflows: 3-4 iteration scenarios with list_files → read_file → write_file sequences
- Blocking behavior: Verifies execution order with tracking array
- Context preservation: Tests with conversation history
- Error recovery: Tool execution errors handled gracefully

**Test Gaps (Non-Critical):**
- ⚠️ Performance testing: No tests for timing/latency requirements (NFR-1: responses begin within 2 seconds)
- ⚠️ Concurrency testing: No tests for concurrent agent executions (NFR-3: 5 concurrent users)
- ℹ️ Retry logic: No tests for OpenAI API rate limit scenarios (could add when implementing retry in future)

### Architectural Alignment

**Alignment with AGENT-EXECUTION-SPEC.md:** ✅ **Strong**
- Section 3 (Agentic Execution Loop): Correctly implements pause-load-continue pattern
- Message structure: Follows OpenAI ChatCompletionMessageParam types
- Tool execution: Blocking behavior matches specification requirements

**Alignment with Story Context 4.1:** ✅ **Strong**
- All interfaces match: ExecutionResult, executeAgent signature
- Dependencies correctly stubbed: processCriticalActions, buildSystemPrompt, executeToolCall, getToolDefinitions
- MAX_ITERATIONS = 50 per constraint specification

**Stub Function Design:** ✅ **Good**
- Clear TODO comments marking integration points for Stories 4.3, 4.5, 4.8
- Stub implementations provide minimal functionality (empty context, existing patterns)
- Console logs indicate when stubs are called for debugging

**Recommendation:** Define TypeScript interfaces for stub function signatures to ensure future implementations match contracts:

```typescript
// Example for Story 4.3 integration
interface ICriticalActionsProcessor {
  processCriticalActions(agent: Agent, bundleRoot: string): Promise<CriticalContext>;
}
```

### Code Quality and Risk Review

**TypeScript Quality:** ✅ **Excellent**
- No TypeScript diagnostics or linting errors
- Proper use of OpenAI SDK types (ChatCompletionMessageParam)
- Clear interface definitions (ExecutionResult, CriticalContext)

**Error Handling:** ✅ **Good**
- Agent not found: Line 227 throws clear error
- OpenAI API failures: Lines 357-361 catch and rethrow with context
- Missing message: Line 286 validates response structure
- MAX_ITERATIONS: Lines 364-369 prevent infinite loops with clear error

**Risk: Tool execution errors** - ⚠️ Medium
Lines 188-196 return structured error format `{success: false, error: ...}` which allows execution to continue. This is correct behavior (agent can recover from tool failures), but consider:
- Add structured error types for better error handling downstream
- Consider adding retry logic for transient file system errors (EBUSY, EAGAIN)

**Security:** ✅ **Good**
- No injection vulnerabilities (tool execution delegated to existing validated functions)
- Error messages don't leak sensitive paths (lines 189-194)
- API key handled securely via environment variables

**Performance:** ✅ **Good**
- Performance timing tracked: lines 222, 270, 334, 344, 367
- Synchronous tool execution acceptable for MVP (sequential file operations)
- Memory: Messages array grows linearly with iterations (acceptable given MAX_ITERATIONS=50)

**Recommendation:** Add performance monitoring to track average iterations per agent/workflow type for future optimization insights.

**Logging Quality:** ✅ **Excellent**
- Clear prefixes: `[agenticLoop]`, `[read_file]`, `[write_file]`, `[list_files]`
- Structured information: iteration count, tool names, parameters, timing
- Success/error indicators: ✅/❌ emoji for visual clarity
- Debug-friendly: Lines 154, 162, 173 include timestamps and byte counts

### Security Notes

**File Operations Security:** ✅ Delegated
Lines 144-146 delegate to existing Epic 2 file operation functions (readFileContent, writeFileContent, listFiles) which implement path security validation per Epic 2 Story 2.8. Path traversal prevention, access control, and symbolic link resolution handled in those functions.

**API Key Security:** ✅ **Good**
Line 18 imports from `@/lib/utils/env` which loads OPENAI_API_KEY from environment variables. No hardcoded secrets.

**Error Message Sanitization:** ✅ **Good**
Line 189: `err.message || String(err)` prevents exposing raw error objects. Console errors (line 190) are server-side only, not returned to user.

**No Critical Security Issues Identified**

### Best-Practices and References

**Tech Stack Alignment:**
- ✅ **Next.js 14.2.0:** Uses App Router patterns, proper API route structure
- ✅ **TypeScript 5:** Strong typing with OpenAI SDK types, proper interfaces
- ✅ **Jest 30.2.0:** Comprehensive test suite with proper mocking
- ✅ **OpenAI SDK 4.104.0:** Correct usage of chat.completions.create with tools parameter

**Best Practices Applied:**
- ✅ Single Responsibility: Module focused solely on execution loop logic
- ✅ Dependency Injection: Client and agent loader injected/imported, not hardcoded
- ✅ Test Coverage: 25 tests with unit + integration levels
- ✅ Documentation: Comprehensive JSDoc comments with AC references
- ✅ Error First: All async operations wrapped in try/catch
- ✅ Append-Only Messages: Lines 294, 329 never modify existing messages (immutable pattern)

**References Consulted:**
- OpenAI Function Calling Docs: https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/function-calling
- OpenAI ChatCompletionMessageParam types: Correctly used for tool role messages
- AGENT-EXECUTION-SPEC.md: Section 3 implementation verified

**Minor Suggestion:** Consider adding exponential backoff retry for OpenAI API rate limits (HTTP 429):

```typescript
// Example retry wrapper
async function callOpenAIWithRetry(client, params, maxRetries = 3) {
  for (let i = 0; i < maxRetries; i++) {
    try {
      return await client.chat.completions.create(params);
    } catch (err) {
      if (err.status === 429 && i < maxRetries - 1) {
        await sleep(Math.pow(2, i) * 1000); // exponential backoff
        continue;
      }
      throw err;
    }
  }
}
```
