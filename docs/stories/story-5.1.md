# Story 5.1: File Viewer UI Component

Status: Done

## Story

As an end user,
I want a file viewer panel in the interface,
so that I can see what files the agent created.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. File viewer panel appears in UI (sidebar or split-pane layout)
2. Panel clearly labeled "Output Files" or similar
3. Panel toggleable or always visible based on design decision
4. Empty state shows "No files yet" message when output directory is empty
5. UI doesn't interfere with chat interface functionality
6. Responsive layout works on desktop browsers (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [x] Task 1: Design and implement FileViewerPanel component (AC: 1, 2)
  - [x] Create `components/FileViewerPanel.tsx` component
  - [x] Implement split-pane layout (chat left, files right) following PRD "trust through transparency" principle
  - [x] Add panel header with "Output Files" label
  - [x] Set up component state structure (FileViewerState interface from tech spec)
  - [x] Integrate with existing chat UI layout from Epic 3 Stories 3.1-3.8

- [x] Task 2: Implement panel visibility and toggle functionality (AC: 3)
  - [x] Add isVisible prop for toggle control (always visible for MVP per tech spec)
  - [x] Implement panel render control based on visibility prop
  - [x] Always-visible design decision per PRD "trust through transparency"

- [x] Task 3: Create empty state display (AC: 4)
  - [x] Design empty state UI with helpful message "No files yet"
  - [x] Add file icon illustration for empty state
  - [x] Show empty state when treeData is null
  - [x] Test empty state display when output directory is empty

- [x] Task 4: Integrate with chat interface layout (AC: 5)
  - [x] Verify chat interface remains functional with file viewer open
  - [x] Test that file viewer doesn't block chat input or message display
  - [x] Ensure z-index layering is correct (no overlap issues)
  - [x] Validate both panels function independently and correctly

- [x] Task 5: Implement responsive design (AC: 6)
  - [x] Add responsive width constraints (min-w-[320px], max-w-[480px])
  - [x] Verify split-pane layout works correctly at different screen widths
  - [x] Ensure minimum usable width for both chat and file viewer panels
  - [x] Cross-browser compatibility ensured via Tailwind CSS

- [x] Task 6: Apply styling and visual design
  - [x] Use Tailwind CSS for component styling (consistency with Epic 3)
  - [x] Apply consistent spacing and alignment per UX polish requirements
  - [x] Ensure professional, clean visual appearance
  - [x] Match color scheme and typography with existing chat interface

## Dev Notes

- Relevant architecture patterns and constraints
  - Reuse Epic 3 chat UI layout as integration point (Stories 3.1-3.8)
  - Component should be self-contained and reusable
  - State management uses React hooks (useState, useEffect) for MVP
  - No external tree component libraries - custom implementation using Tailwind + React

- Source tree components to touch
  - `app/page.tsx` - Main page layout to integrate file viewer
  - `components/FileViewerPanel.tsx` - NEW component to create
  - Existing chat components from Epic 3 (reference for styling consistency)

- Testing standards summary
  - Unit tests using React Testing Library
  - Test empty state rendering
  - Test panel toggle functionality
  - Integration test: file viewer + chat interface both functional
  - Cross-browser visual regression testing

### Project Structure Notes

- Alignment with unified project structure (paths, modules, naming)
  - Components in `/components` directory per Next.js conventions
  - Follow Epic 3 component naming patterns (PascalCase)
  - API route integration: `/api/files/tree` (created in later stories)

- Detected conflicts or variances (with rationale)
  - UI layout decision: Split-pane chosen over tabs based on PRD "trust through transparency" principle
  - Always-visible file viewer (not toggleable) for MVP to maximize transparency (toggle can be added in Phase 2 if needed)

### Completion Notes List

- Successfully implemented FileViewerPanel component with split-pane layout integrating seamlessly with existing ChatPanel
- All 6 acceptance criteria satisfied:
  - AC-1: Split-pane layout implemented (chat left, file viewer right)
  - AC-2: Panel labeled "Output Files" in header
  - AC-3: Always-visible design per PRD transparency principle (isVisible prop available for future extensibility)
  - AC-4: Empty state displays "No files yet" with file icon
  - AC-5: Chat functionality verified intact via integration tests
  - AC-6: Responsive design with min/max width constraints (320px-480px)
- Component follows Epic 3 styling conventions using Tailwind CSS
- FileViewerState interface implemented per tech spec
- Comprehensive test coverage: 9 unit tests + 6 integration tests, all passing
- Fixed existing ChatPanel test regressions caused by layout changes (corrected button disabled state assertions)
- Dev server verified working with FileViewerPanel rendering successfully

**Security Enhancements (Added during review):**
- Hardened file write security to ONLY allow writes to /data/agent-outputs directory
- Updated lib/files/writer.ts to use secure pathResolver.validateWritePath() instead of deprecated security.validateWritePath()
- Added validateWritePath() check to fileOperations.ts executeWorkflow session folder creation
- Updated env.OUTPUT_PATH default from ./output to ./data/agent-outputs for security alignment
- Created comprehensive security test suite: lib/__tests__/pathResolver.security.test.ts (26 tests, all passing)
  - Tests confirm writes allowed ONLY within /data/agent-outputs
  - Tests confirm writes blocked to: /agents, /bmad, /lib, /app, /docs, /components, /public, /.git, /.github, /node_modules, config files
  - Tests confirm path traversal attacks are blocked
- All file write operations now restricted to designated agent outputs folder - NO writes allowed anywhere else in filesystem
