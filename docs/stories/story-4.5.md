# Story 4.5: Refactor File Operation Tools for Agentic Loop

Status: Done

## Story

As a **developer**,
I want **to refactor existing read_file, write_file, list_files tools**,
So that **they work correctly within the agentic execution loop and support path variables**.

## Acceptance Criteria

**AC-4.5.1:** Update read_file to resolve path variables before reading

**AC-4.5.2:** Update save_output (replaces write_file) to resolve path variables before writing

**AC-4.5.3:** Update list_files to resolve path variables before listing (optional - consider deprecating if not used)

**AC-4.5.4:** Tools return results in format compatible with agentic loop context injection

**AC-4.5.5:** Tool results include resolved paths for debugging

**AC-4.5.6:** Path security validation works with resolved paths (no traversal attacks)

**AC-4.5.7:** Tools work with bundle structure ({bundle-root}/workflows/*, {core-root}/tasks/*)

**AC-4.5.8:** Add execute_workflow tool for loading workflow configurations

**AC-4.5.9:** Existing Epic 2 tool tests refactored to test with path variables

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Patterns and Constraints

**Agentic Loop Integration:**
File operation tools must work within the agentic execution loop (Story 4.1). This means:
- Tools are called via OpenAI function calling, not directly by backend
- Tool results must be JSON-serializable for injection into conversation messages
- Execution pauses at tool call, waits for result, then continues
- Tool results injected as {role: 'tool', tool_call_id, content: JSON.stringify(result)}

**Path Resolution Integration (Story 4.2):**
All file paths must resolve variables BEFORE execution:
- {bundle-root} → bmad/custom/bundles/{bundle-name}/
- {core-root} → bmad/core/
- {project-root} → application root
- {config_source}:variable → loaded from bundle config.yaml
- Path resolution includes security validation (no traversal attacks)

**Tool Evolution from Epic 2:**
Epic 2 implemented basic file operations without path variables or agentic loop support. This story refactors those tools to:
- Support path variable resolution
- Work with bundle structure
- Return results compatible with agentic loop
- Add execute_workflow tool for loading workflow configurations

**New Tool: execute_workflow:**
Replaces manual workflow loading pattern. Agent requests workflow via tool call, receives:
- Workflow configuration (parsed YAML)
- Instructions content (loaded from file)
- Template content (if applicable)
- Resolved variables from bundle config

This enables lazy-loading of workflows - only load when agent explicitly requests them.

### Component Locations and File Paths

**Primary Implementation:**
- `lib/tools/fileOperations.ts` - Refactored file operation tools (update or create new)
- `lib/tools/toolDefinitions.ts` - OpenAI tool schema definitions (create new)

**Dependencies:**
- `lib/pathResolver.ts` - Path variable resolution (from Story 4.2)
- `fs/promises` - File system operations
- `path` - Path manipulation
- `yaml` library - Workflow YAML parsing

**Integration Points:**
- Called by: Agentic execution loop (Story 4.1) via executeToolCall handler
- Uses: PathContext from Story 4.2, bundleConfig from Story 4.3
- Provides data to: Agent workflows, output generation

**Epic 2 Deprecated Components:**
- `lib/fileOperations.ts` (if exists) - Replace with new implementation
- Simple function calling loop - Replaced by agentic loop (Story 4.1)

**Tool Schema Example (read_file):**
```typescript
{
  type: 'function',
  function: {
    name: 'read_file',
    description: 'Read a file from the bundle or core BMAD system. Use this when you need to load configuration files, templates, or any other file referenced in agent instructions.',
    parameters: {
      type: 'object',
      properties: {
        file_path: {
          type: 'string',
          description: 'Path to file. Can use variables: {bundle-root}/path/to/file, {core-root}/path/to/file'
        }
      },
      required: ['file_path']
    }
  }
}
```

**Tool Implementation Example (executeReadFile):**
```typescript
async function executeReadFile(
  params: { file_path: string },
  context: PathContext
): Promise<ToolResult> {
  const resolvedPath = resolvePath(params.file_path, context);

  try {
    const content = await fs.readFile(resolvedPath, 'utf-8');
    return {
      success: true,
      path: resolvedPath,
      content: content,
      size: content.length
    };
  } catch (error) {
    return {
      success: false,
      error: error.message,
      path: resolvedPath
    };
  }
}
```

### Testing Requirements

**Unit Tests (Required):**
1. **Path Resolution** - All tools resolve {bundle-root}, {core-root}, {config_source}:var correctly
2. **Security** - Path traversal attacks blocked, access outside allowed directories rejected
3. **File Operations** - read_file, save_output, execute_workflow work as expected
4. **Error Handling** - Missing files, permission errors, invalid YAML handled gracefully
5. **Tool Results** - All results JSON-serializable and structured correctly

**Integration Tests (Required):**
1. **Agentic Loop Integration** - Tool calls execute, results inject into conversation messages
2. **Bundle Structure** - Tools work with real bundle directory structure (requirements-workflow)
3. **Workflow Loading** - execute_workflow loads complete workflow context
4. **End-to-End** - Complete workflow execution using all tools in sequence

**Epic 2 Test Migration:**
- Review Epic 2 file operation tests for reusable scenarios
- Migrate security tests to new path resolution system
- Update tests to use PathContext parameter
- Add path variable resolution test cases

- Story 4.3 (Critical Actions Processor) - Config loading pattern reference
- Story 4.4 (Bundle Discovery) - Bundle structure tools must support

### Project Structure Notes

**Alignment with Agentic Architecture:**
This story completes the tool layer of the agentic execution architecture:
- Story 4.1: Agentic loop framework
- Story 4.2: Path resolution system
- Story 4.3: Critical actions processor
- Story 4.4: Bundle discovery
- **Story 4.5: File operation tools** (this story)

Together, these enable agents to:
1. Initialize with bundle config (Story 4.3)
2. Request workflow via execute_workflow tool
3. Load instructions/templates via read_file tool
4. Generate outputs via save_output tool
5. All paths resolve correctly via Story 4.2

**Replacement of Epic 2 Implementation:**
Epic 2 Stories 2.3-2.5 implemented basic file operations. This story replaces them with:
- Path variable support (was missing)
- Agentic loop compatibility (was simple function calling)
- Bundle structure awareness (was flat file structure)
- execute_workflow tool (was manual workflow loading)

**Integration with Story 4.1:**
Agentic execution loop calls tools via executeToolCall handler:
```typescript
async function executeToolCall(toolCall, bundleRoot) {
  const { name, arguments: argsString } = toolCall.function;
  const args = JSON.parse(argsString);

  const context = {
    bundleRoot,
    coreRoot: 'bmad/core',
    projectRoot: process.cwd(),
    bundleConfig: currentBundleConfig
  };

  switch (name) {
    case 'read_file':
      return await executeReadFile(args, context);
    case 'save_output':
      return await executeSaveOutput(args, context);
    case 'execute_workflow':
      return await executeWorkflow(args, context);
    default:
      return { success: false, error: `Unknown tool: ${name}` };
  }
}
```

**No Conflicts with Existing Code:**
- Story 4.2 path resolver is used, not replaced
- Story 4.3 critical actions can continue using direct file reads during init
- Story 4.4 bundle discovery is independent (provides bundlePath for context)
- Epic 1 API routes remain unchanged

## Senior Developer Review (AI)

**Reviewer:** Bryan
**Date:** 2025-10-05
**Outcome:** Approve

### Summary

Story 4.5 successfully refactors file operation tools to work within the agentic execution loop with comprehensive path variable support. The implementation demonstrates excellent code quality, thorough testing (11 integration tests covering all acceptance criteria), and strong alignment with Epic 4's architectural vision. All 9 acceptance criteria are fully satisfied with zero regressions.

The implementation is production-ready with one **recommended enhancement** for future integration: updating the agentic loop stub implementations to use the new tools (tracked as follow-up action).

### Key Findings

**High Priority:**
- None

**Medium Priority:**
- **[Med]** Integration Gap: lib/agents/agenticLoop.ts:100-150 still uses stub implementations referencing Epic 2 file operations instead of the new Story 4.5 tools. While this doesn't block Story 4.5 completion, it should be addressed to realize the full architectural benefits.

**Low Priority:**
- **[Low]** Type Safety Enhancement: Consider adding stricter typing for the ToolResult `[key: string]: any` index signature to prevent accidental property additions (lib/tools/fileOperations.ts:35).

### Acceptance Criteria Coverage

✅ **AC-4.5.1:** read_file resolves path variables - SATISFIED

- Security test coverage: fileOperations.integration.test.ts:378-394

✅ **AC-4.5.7:** Bundle structure support - SATISFIED
- Test coverage: fileOperations.integration.test.ts:44-141
- Supports {bundle-root}/workflows/*, {core-root}/tasks/*, {config_source}:var

✅ **AC-4.5.8:** execute_workflow tool implementation - SATISFIED
- Implementation: lib/tools/fileOperations.ts:193-292
- Includes recursive variable resolution: fileOperations.ts:304-351
- Test coverage: fileOperations.integration.test.ts:143-295

✅ **AC-4.5.9:** Epic 2 tests refactored - SATISFIED
- New integration test suite created with path variable support
- 11 comprehensive integration tests covering all ACs

### Test Coverage and Gaps

**Strengths:**
- 11 integration tests with 100% pass rate
- Real file system operations (no mocks) ensure production readiness
- Comprehensive error handling scenarios tested
- End-to-end workflow execution tested (test lines 298-374)

**Test Coverage:**
- Bundle structure support: 4 tests (AC-4.5.7)
- Workflow loading: 3 tests (AC-4.5.8)
- End-to-end execution: 1 test
- Security and error handling: 3 tests (AC-4.5.6)

**Minor Gaps:**
- No explicit test for YAML parsing errors in execute_workflow (handled generically at line 278-283)
- No test for circular/infinite variable resolution (mitigated by implementation logic)

### Architectural Alignment

**Excellent Alignment:**
- ✅ Seamless integration with Story 4.2 (Path Resolution) via resolvePath function
- ✅ Proper PathContext usage throughout
- ✅ Clean separation of concerns: tools, definitions, and tests in separate modules
- ✅ OpenAI tool schemas properly defined (lib/tools/toolDefinitions.ts)

**Integration Points:**
- Story 4.1 (Agentic Loop): Tools designed for integration, but stub still in place (lib/agents/agenticLoop.ts:100-150)
- Story 4.2 (Path Resolution): Full integration via resolvePath and PathContext
- Story 4.3 (Critical Actions): Independent, no conflicts
- Story 4.4 (Bundle Discovery): Compatible bundle structure support

**Architecture Decision - resolveWorkflowVariables:**
The recursive variable resolution pattern (fileOperations.ts:304-351) is well-designed with proper error handling for invalid paths. The try-catch pattern at lines 316-319 prevents resolution failures from breaking workflows.

### Security Notes

**Security Strengths:**
- ✅ All paths resolve through Story 4.2's secure resolvePath function
- ✅ Path traversal attacks blocked (test: fileOperations.integration.test.ts:378-394)
- ✅ Access restricted to allowed directories (bundleRoot, coreRoot)
- ✅ Security errors properly caught and returned (fileOperations.ts:109-115, 166-172, 272-277)

**Security Validation:**
- Path resolution includes security checks before file operations
- Error messages expose minimal path information (using params.file_path in security errors, not resolvedPath)
- No symbolic link attack tests, but Story 4.2 pathResolver handles this
