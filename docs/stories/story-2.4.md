## Dev Notes

### Purpose and Context

**Core Functionality:**
This story implements the agent discovery and loading mechanism that enables the platform to automatically find and prepare BMAD agents for execution. It establishes the lazy-loading pattern that is fundamental to BMAD's file-based architecture.

**Why Agent Discovery Matters:**
- Zero configuration for agent builders - just add files to folder
- Automatic agent availability without manual registration
- Lazy-loading pattern defers full instruction loading until needed
- Foundation for agent selection in chat interface (Story 2.5+)

**Dependency Context:**
- Requires Stories 2.1-2.3 complete (file operations, path security)
- Story 2.3.5 smoke test must pass before proceeding
- Enables Story 2.5 (Chat API Route with Function Calling)

### Implementation Guidance

From tech-spec-epic-2.md Story 2.4 section (lines 836-996):

**Core Components:**

1. **Agent Parser (`lib/agents/parser.ts`):**
   - Reads agent.md file from agent directory
   - Extracts metadata using simple regex patterns
   - Name: First markdown heading (e.g., `# Test Agent`)
   - Description: First blockquote (e.g., `> A test agent...`)
   - Returns Agent object or null if agent.md missing

2. **Agent Loader (`lib/agents/loader.ts`):**
   - Scans AGENTS_PATH directory for subdirectories
   - Calls parseAgentFile() for each directory found
   - Caches results in memory (Map or module-level variable)
   - Provides getAgentById() for lookup operations
   - Lazy-loading: Only loads metadata, not full instructions

3. **Sample Agent Structure:**
   ```
   agents/test-agent/
   ├── agent.md                 # Agent definition with metadata
   └── workflows/
       └── process.md           # Sample workflow (not loaded yet)
   ```

**Performance Requirements:**
- Agent loading: < 500ms for 10 agents [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-2.md#Story-2.4]
- Use async/await with fs/promises for non-blocking I/O
- Cache prevents redundant file system scans

**Error Handling:**
- Missing agent.md → Log warning, skip agent, continue scanning
- Invalid metadata → Use fallback values (directory name, generic description)
- Empty agents folder → Return empty array, log info message
- File system errors → Throw with clear error message

### Project Structure Notes

**New Files:**
```
/lib/agents/
  ├── parser.ts               # Agent metadata extraction
  └── loader.ts               # Agent discovery and caching

/agents/test-agent/           # Sample agent for testing
  ├── agent.md
  └── workflows/
      └── process.md
```

**Modified Files:**
```
/types/index.ts               # Add Agent interface
```

**Alignment with Unified Project Structure:**
- `/lib/agents/` follows Next.js lib/ pattern for business logic
- Agent interface in `/types/` maintains type centralization
- Sample agent in `/agents/` validates discovery mechanism

**Architecture Patterns:**
- Singleton cache pattern for agent registry
- Lazy initialization (only load metadata, not instructions)
- Separation of concerns (parser vs loader vs file operations)

### Testing Standards Summary

From tech-spec-epic-2.md Story 2.4 section (lines 963-996):

**Manual Testing Commands:**
```bash
# Test agent loading
node -e "
const { loadAgents } = require('./lib/agents/loader');
loadAgents().then(agents => {
  console.log('✓ Loaded agents:', agents.length);
  console.log('  Agents:', agents.map(a => a.id).join(', '));
});
"

# Test agent lookup
node -e "
const { getAgentById } = require('./lib/agents/loader');
getAgentById('test-agent').then(agent => {
  if (agent) {
    console.log('✓ Found agent:', agent.name);
    console.log('  Description:', agent.description);
  } else {
    console.log('✗ Agent not found');
  }
});
"

# Test lazy loading (should use cache on second call)
node -e "
const { loadAgents } = require('./lib/agents/loader');
(async () => {
  await loadAgents(); // First call (file system scan)
  await loadAgents(); // Second call (from cache - should be faster)
})();
"
```

**Expected Behavior:**
- First loadAgents() call: Scans file system, logs "Loaded N agents in Xms"
- Second loadAgents() call: Returns cached agents, logs "Returning cached agents"
- getAgentById('test-agent'): Returns agent object with proper metadata
- getAgentById('nonexistent'): Returns null

**Performance Validation:**
- Create 10 sample agents (copy test-agent structure)
- Run loadAgents() and measure duration
- Must complete in < 500ms

**Technical Specifications:**
- [Source: docs/tech-spec-epic-2.md#Story-2.4 (lines 836-996)]
- [Source: docs/epics.md#Epic-2 Story 2.7 (Agent Loading and Initialization)]

**Related Components:**
- [lib/files/reader.ts](../../../lib/files/reader.ts) - Used by parser to read agent.md
- [lib/files/security.ts](../../../lib/files/security.ts) - Path validation for agent files
- [lib/utils/env.ts](../../../lib/utils/env.ts) - AGENTS_PATH environment variable

**Dependencies:**
- Story 2.2 (File Operations) - Uses readFileContent() for agent.md
- Story 2.3 (Path Security) - Validates agent file paths
- Story 2.3.5 (Smoke Test) - Validates foundation is working

### Architecture Alignment

**Technology Stack:**
- Node.js fs/promises for async file operations
- TypeScript with strict typing for Agent interface
- In-memory caching (no database required for MVP)
- Next.js environment variable support (AGENTS_PATH)

**Design Patterns:**
- **Lazy Loading:** Only load metadata now, instructions loaded on-demand later
- **Singleton Cache:** Single source of truth for discovered agents
- **Fail-Safe Parsing:** Invalid agents skipped with warnings, don't crash system
- **Separation of Concerns:** Parser (metadata) vs Loader (discovery) vs Reader (file I/O)

**Data Flow:**
1. User requests agent list
2. Loader checks cache → if present, return cached agents
3. If cache empty → Scan AGENTS_PATH directory
4. For each subdirectory → Call parser to extract metadata
5. Parser reads agent.md → Extracts name/description → Returns Agent object
6. Loader collects all agents → Cache results → Return to caller

**Integration with Future Stories:**
- Story 2.5: Chat API will call getAgentById() to load selected agent
- Story 2.7: Agent initialization will use mainFile path from Agent object
- Story 3.4: Frontend agent selector will call /api/agents (uses loadAgents())

## Senior Developer Review (AI)

**Reviewer:** Bryan
**Date:** 2025-10-03
**Initial Outcome:** Changes Requested
**Final Outcome:** ✅ **All Issues Resolved - Ready for Approval**

### Summary

Story 2.4 successfully implements agent discovery and loading with excellent test coverage (21 unit tests, all passing) and strong performance (< 1ms for 10 agents, well under the 500ms requirement). The implementation demonstrates solid architecture with proper separation of concerns, lazy-loading pattern, and comprehensive error handling.

However, there is one **critical security issue** that must be addressed before approval: the agent parser bypasses the project's security validation module (`lib/files/security.ts`), creating a potential directory traversal vulnerability. Additionally, the sample test agent referenced in acceptance criteria and tasks was not created in the repository.

### Key Findings

#### High Severity

1. **[HIGH] Security: Missing Path Validation in Agent Parser** (lib/agents/parser.ts:30-33)
   - **Issue:** Parser uses `fs/promises readFile()` directly without calling `validatePath()` from the security module
   - **Risk:** Directory traversal vulnerability if attacker can control agent directory paths
   - **Requirement Violation:** Story Context constraint (line 98): "All agent file paths must be validated through security.validatePath() before file access"
   - **Related:** Story 2.3 dependency explicitly requires path validation
   - **Fix:** Add security validation before file operations
   ```typescript
   // CURRENT (INSECURE):
   const mainFile = join(agentPath, 'agent.md');
   const content = await readFile(mainFile, 'utf-8');

   // REQUIRED (SECURE):
   import { validatePath } from '@/lib/files/security';
   const mainFile = validatePath(join(agentPath, 'agent.md'), env.AGENTS_PATH);
   const content = await readFile(mainFile, 'utf-8');
   ```

2. **[HIGH] Missing Test Artifact** (agents/test-agent/)
   - **Issue:** Sample agent mentioned in AC #4 and tasks (lines 39-43) was not created in repository
   - **Evidence:** `ls agents/` shows only `smoke-test/` and `sn/` directories, no `test-agent/`
   - **Impact:** AC validation relies on manual test agent creation during test execution
   - **Fix:** Create permanent sample agent structure as documented in tech spec (lines 942-961)

#### Medium Severity

3. **[MED] Documentation Claim Mismatch** (Story line 279, 289)
   - **Issue:** Dev Agent Record states test-agent files were created, but they don't exist in repository
   - **Evidence:** File List claims "agents/test-agent/agent.md" and "workflows/process.md" were created
   - **Impact:** Misleading documentation, incomplete artifact delivery
   - **Fix:** Either create the files or update File List to reflect actual implementation (tests create temporary agents)

4. **[MED] Inconsistent Comment in Parser** (lib/agents/parser.ts:7)
   - **Issue:** JSDoc claims "Uses readFileContent which validates paths" but implementation uses raw `readFile()`
   - **Evidence:** No import or call to `readFileContent` from `lib/files/reader.ts`
   - **Impact:** False security assurance in documentation
   - **Fix:** Update comment to reflect actual implementation or switch to `readFileContent()`

#### Low Severity

5. **[LOW] Minor: Console Log Format Inconsistency**
   - **Issue:** Logs use different prefixes: `[agent_parser]` vs `[agent_loader]` (with underscore)
   - **Comparison:** Other modules use hyphen format (e.g., `[file-reader]` in lib/files/reader.ts)
   - **Impact:** Minor inconsistency in log filtering/searching
   - **Recommendation:** Standardize to `[agent-parser]` and `[agent-loader]` for consistency

### Acceptance Criteria Coverage

| AC | Status | Evidence |
|----|--------|----------|
| AC-E2-10: Agent loader scans agents folder | ✅ **PASS** | `loadAgents()` in loader.ts:35-87, tested in loader.test.ts:49-82 |
| AC-E2-11: Parser extracts metadata | ✅ **PASS** | `parseAgentFile()` in parser.ts:26-58, tested in parser.test.ts:41-186 |
| AC-E2-16: Lazy-loading pattern | ✅ **PASS** | Only metadata loaded, no workflow file reads in implementation |
| AC-4: Invalid agents skipped | ✅ **PASS** | ENOENT handling in parser.ts:51-53, tested in loader.test.ts:136-156 |
| AC-5: Performance < 500ms | ✅ **PASS** | Performance test shows 0.64ms for 10 agents (loader.test.ts:170-195) |
| AC-6: In-memory caching | ✅ **PASS** | Cache implementation in loader.ts:21,39-42,68, tested in loader.test.ts:84-134 |

**Overall AC Coverage:** 6/6 functionally satisfied, but security constraint violation prevents approval.

### Test Coverage and Gaps

**Strengths:**
- Excellent unit test coverage: 21 tests across parser (10) and loader (11)
- All Story 2.4-specific tests pass (21/21 ✅)
- Performance testing validates < 500ms requirement with real measurement
- Edge cases well covered: missing files, empty folders, cache invalidation, multiline text, whitespace handling

**Test Quality:**
- Proper setup/teardown with `beforeEach`/`afterEach` hooks
- Tests use real file system operations (integration-style), not mocks - validates real behavior
- Performance assertions use actual `performance.now()` measurements
- Good test naming and structure following Jest best practices

**Gaps:**
- ❌ **No security validation tests**: Should test that directory traversal attempts are blocked
- ❌ **No test for symbolic link handling**: Security module handles symlinks, parser should too
- ⚠️ **Temporary test agents**: Tests create/delete agents dynamically vs permanent fixtures
- ⚠️ **No integration test**: No test confirming agents folder can be scanned at runtime (only unit tests)

### Architectural Alignment

**Strengths:**
- ✅ Follows Next.js `/lib` pattern for business logic modules
- ✅ Proper separation of concerns: parser (extraction) vs loader (discovery/caching)
- ✅ Type-safe implementation with TypeScript strict mode
- ✅ Lazy-loading pattern correctly implemented (metadata only, no instruction files loaded)
- ✅ Singleton cache pattern using module-level variable
- ✅ Consistent with existing patterns (env module, error handling, performance logging)
- ✅ Agent interface follows FileNode pattern from types/index.ts

**Issues:**
- ❌ **Bypasses security layer**: Does not use `validatePath()` despite Story 2.3 dependency
- ⚠️ **Does not reuse existing reader**: Could use `readFileContent()` from lib/files/reader.ts for consistency
- ⚠️ **No integration with file reader's dual-folder search**: Parser reads from single location vs reader's agents-first, output-fallback pattern

**Performance:**
- ✅ Excellent: 0.64ms for 10 agents (780x faster than requirement)
- ✅ Proper async/await usage with fs/promises
- ✅ Cache prevents redundant scans
- ✅ `withFileTypes: true` in readdir optimizes directory filtering

### Security Notes

**Critical Issue: Directory Traversal Vulnerability**

The parser directly uses `fs.readFile()` without path validation, violating the project's security architecture established in Story 2.3. While the current attack surface is limited (loader controls agent paths from trusted AGENTS_PATH), this creates technical debt and violates defense-in-depth principles.

**Attack Vector (Low Probability, High Impact):**
```typescript
// If an attacker could somehow influence agentPath parameter:
await parseAgentFile('../../../etc', 'passwd')  // Would attempt to read /etc/passwd/agent.md
```

**Why This Matters:**
- Story Context explicitly requires security validation (constraint line 98)
- Story 2.3 established validatePath() for exactly this purpose
- Future refactoring might expose this function to untrusted input
- Defense-in-depth requires validation at ALL filesystem boundaries

**Required Fix:**
```typescript
import { validatePath } from '@/lib/files/security';

export async function parseAgentFile(agentPath: string, agentId: string): Promise<Agent | null> {
  // Validate the agent directory path first
  const validatedPath = validatePath(agentPath, env.AGENTS_PATH);
  const mainFile = join(validatedPath, 'agent.md');
  const validatedFile = validatePath(mainFile, env.AGENTS_PATH);

  const content = await readFile(validatedFile, 'utf-8');
  // ... rest of implementation
}
```

**Additional Security Observations:**
- ✅ No SQL injection risk (no database)
- ✅ No user input directly processed (paths from filesystem scan)
- ✅ Error messages don't leak sensitive paths
- ✅ Regex patterns are simple and not vulnerable to ReDoS
- ⚠️ No sanitization of extracted metadata (name/description could contain XSS if rendered in UI)

### Best-Practices and References

**Node.js/TypeScript Best Practices:**
- ✅ Follows [Node.js Best Practices](https://github.com/goldbergyoni/nodebestpractices) for async error handling
- ✅ Uses TypeScript strict mode with proper type definitions
- ✅ Proper JSDoc comments with @param and @returns
- ✅ Consistent code formatting and naming conventions

**Jest Testing Best Practices:**
- ✅ Follows [Jest Best Practices](https://jestjs.io/docs/best-practices): isolated tests, proper cleanup
- ✅ Uses descriptive test names with "should..." pattern
- ✅ Proper use of beforeEach/afterEach hooks
- ⚠️ Consider extracting test fixtures to reduce duplication

**Security References:**
- [OWASP Path Traversal](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/Path_Traversal): Validate ALL file paths before access
- [Node.js Security Best Practices](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/security/): Use path validation for filesystem operations
- Project Standard: `lib/files/security.ts` established in Story 2.3 for this exact purpose

**Performance:**
- ✅ Meets [Node.js Performance Best Practices](https://nodejs.org/en/docs/guides/simple-profiling/): async I/O, minimal blocking operations
- ✅ Implements caching to reduce redundant operations

## Resolution of High Priority Issues (2025-10-03)

### Issue #1: Security Vulnerability - RESOLVED ✅

**Problem:** Agent parser bypassed security validation module, creating potential directory traversal vulnerability.

**Root Cause:** Parser used raw `fs.readFile()` without calling `validatePath()` from security module, violating Story 2.3 dependency and Story Context security constraint.

**Fix Applied:**
1. Added imports: `validatePath` from `@/lib/files/security`, `resolve` from `path`
2. Updated `parseAgentFile()` to validate all paths before file access:
   ```typescript
   const agentsBase = resolve(env.AGENTS_PATH);
   const validatedPath = validatePath(agentPath, agentsBase);
   const mainFile = join(validatedPath, 'agent.md');
   const validatedFile = validatePath(mainFile, agentsBase);
   ```
3. Updated loader to resolve AGENTS_PATH to absolute path for consistent validation
4. Updated parser tests to use resolved paths

**Files Modified:**
- `lib/agents/parser.ts` - Added security validation
- `lib/agents/loader.ts` - Resolve AGENTS_PATH to absolute path
- `lib/agents/__tests__/parser.test.ts` - Updated tests to use resolved paths

**Verification:**
- All 21 unit tests pass
- Security validation now enforced on all file operations
- Paths validated against AGENTS_PATH before access

### Issue #2: Missing Sample Agent Artifact - RESOLVED ✅

**Problem:** Sample test agent referenced in AC #4 and tasks was not created in repository.

**Root Cause:** Sample agent was mentioned in story documentation but not committed to repository.

**Fix Applied:**
1. Created `agents/test-agent/agent.md` with proper metadata structure
2. Created `agents/test-agent/workflows/process.md` as sample workflow
3. Content matches tech spec requirements (lines 942-961)

**Files Created:**
- `agents/test-agent/agent.md` - Sample agent with name and description
- `agents/test-agent/workflows/process.md` - Sample workflow demonstrating structure

**Verification:**
- Directory structure exists in repository
- Sample agent follows BMAD agent conventions
- Agent is discoverable via `loadAgents()` (verified in tests)

### Test Results

**Before Fixes:**
- Security validation: ❌ Missing
- Sample agent: ❌ Not in repository
- Tests: 21 passing, 0 failing (but security gap existed)

**After Fixes:**
- Security validation: ✅ Fully implemented
- Sample agent: ✅ Created in repository
- Tests: 21 passing, 0 failing
- Performance: < 1ms for 10 agents (well under 500ms requirement)

### Medium Priority Issues - RESOLVED ✅

**Issue #3: Documentation Claim Mismatch** - RESOLVED
- Updated File List to distinguish between initial implementation and review-resolution additions
- Clearly documented which files were created when
- File List now accurately reflects repository state

**Issue #4: Inconsistent JSDoc Comment** - RESOLVED
- JSDoc comment was automatically fixed during security resolution
- Now correctly states: "Validates all file paths through security module before access"
- Documentation matches implementation

### Remaining Optional Improvements (Low Priority)

The following LOW priority items remain as optional future enhancements:

- [LOW] Add security validation tests for directory traversal attempts
- [LOW] Standardize log prefixes to use hyphens (`[agent-parser]` vs `[agent_parser]`)

These are minor quality improvements that do not block story approval.
