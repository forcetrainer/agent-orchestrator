# Story 9.2: Simplify Path Resolver

Status: Ready for Review

## Story

As a **developer**,
I want to **simplify the path resolver from 471 lines to ~150 lines**,
so that **variable resolution is transparent and maintainable**.

## Context

This is the second story of Epic 9 "Simplify Workflow Execution Architecture". After removing the execute_workflow tool in Story 9.1, we now simplify the path resolver that was originally built to support execute_workflow's complex variable resolution requirements.

**Current Problem**: The path resolver (`lib/pathResolver.ts`, 471 lines) handles too many responsibilities:
- Multi-pass nested variable resolution (5 passes!)
- Config variable references `{config_source}:variable_name`
- System variables `{date}`, `{user_name}`, `{session_id}`
- Path variables `{bundle-root}`, `{core-root}`, `{project-root}`
- Circular reference detection
- Config file auto-loading and parsing
- Security validation
- Symlink resolution

**Root Cause**: This complexity was needed to support execute_workflow's "magic" behavior. Now that execute_workflow is removed, most of this complexity can be eliminated.

**Solution**: Reduce path resolver to ~150 lines by:
- **Remove**: `{config_source}:variable_name` resolution (LLM reads config.yaml and extracts values)
- **Remove**: `{date}` and `{user_name}` resolution (LLM generates these)
- **Remove**: `{session_id}` resolution (LLM manages session IDs explicitly per Story 9.1)
- **Remove**: Multi-pass nested variable resolution
- **Remove**: Config file auto-loading and parsing
- **Remove**: Circular reference detection (no longer needed without nested variables)
- **Keep**: Basic path variable resolution (`{bundle-root}`, `{core-root}`, `{project-root}`)
- **Keep**: Security validation (path traversal, write restrictions)
- **Keep**: Symlink resolution with security checks

**Why This is Safe**: Story 9.1 moved session management to conversation initialization, eliminating the need for `{session_id}` variable resolution. LLM will now explicitly handle config loading and variable extraction through `read_file` calls.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Keep** in `lib/pathResolver.ts`:
   - **Generic variable resolution**: Replace variables in format `{variable-name}` with values from PathContext
   - Currently supported variables: `{bundle-root}`, `{core-root}`, `{project-root}` (but architecture is extensible)
   - Simple pattern matching and string replacement (no nested variables, no multi-pass)
   - Security validation (stays within allowed directories)
   - Write path validation (restrict to /data/agent-outputs)
   - Symlink resolution with security checks
2. **Remove** from `lib/pathResolver.ts`:
   - `{config_source}:variable_name` resolution (LLM handles this by reading config.yaml)
   - `{date}` and `{user_name}` resolution (LLM generates these)
   - `{session_id}` resolution (LLM manages session IDs per Story 9.1)
   - Multi-pass nested variable resolution
   - Config file auto-loading and parsing
   - Circular reference detection
3. Path resolver reduced to ~150 lines (68% reduction from 471 lines)
4. All path security tests pass
5. Unit tests updated for simplified resolver
6. `read_file` and `save_output` tools work correctly with simplified resolver
7. Documentation updated to reflect removed functionality

## Dev Notes

### Architectural Context

**Epic 9 Goal**: Refactor workflow execution to LLM-orchestrated pattern by removing over-engineered tool abstractions.

**This Story's Role**: Simplify the path resolver from 471 lines to ~150 lines (68% reduction) by removing complex variable resolution that was only needed to support execute_workflow. This simplification makes variable resolution transparent and gives LLM explicit control.

**Dependencies**:
- **Prerequisites**: Story 9.1 complete (execute_workflow removed, session management in conversation init)
- **Blocks**: Story 9.3 (system prompt needs to know which variables are removed)

### Project Structure Notes

**Files Modified**:
1. `lib/pathResolver.ts` - Simplify from 471 lines to ~150 lines (~320 lines removed)
2. `lib/tools/fileOperations.ts` - May need minor updates if PathContext interface changes
3. `tests/pathResolver.test.ts` - Remove tests for deleted functionality, update for simplified behavior

**Function Removal Candidates** (based on current pathResolver.ts):
- `resolveConfigVariable()` - Config loading and {config_source}:variable_name resolution
- `resolveSystemVariable()` - {date}, {user_name}, {session_id} resolution
- `resolveNestedVariables()` - Multi-pass nested resolution loop
- `detectCircularReferences()` - Circular reference detection
- `loadConfigFile()` - Config file auto-loading and parsing
- Any YAML parsing imports and related utilities

**Functions to Keep**:
- `resolvePath()` - Core path resolution for {bundle-root}, {core-root}, {project-root}
- `validatePath()` - Security validation (path traversal, allowed directories)
- `validateWritePath()` - Write path restrictions to /data/agent-outputs
- `resolveSymlink()` - Symlink resolution with security checks
- Basic path normalization utilities

### Security Preservation (CRITICAL)

**Must Keep All Security Validations**:
1. Path traversal prevention (`../` detection)
2. Absolute path validation (stays within allowed directories)
3. Write path restrictions (only /data/agent-outputs writable)
4. Symlink resolution with security checks
5. Read path allowlist enforcement (bundle, core, output folders only)

**Security Tests Must Pass**:
- Path traversal attacks rejected
- Write attempts to source code directories rejected
- Symlink escape attempts detected and blocked
- Allowed directories (bundle, core, output) accessible
- Security error messages don't leak sensitive path info

### Generic Variable Resolution Architecture

**Design Principle**: Instead of hardcoding specific variable names in the resolver logic, use a **data-driven approach** where the PathContext interface acts as a simple key-value map.

**Implementation**:
```typescript
interface PathContext {
  [key: string]: string  // Generic: any {variable-name} can be resolved

  // Current standard variables (but more can be added):
  'bundle-root': string
  'core-root': string
  'project-root': string
}

// Generic resolution function
function resolvePathVariables(path: string, context: PathContext): string {
  return path.replace(/\{([a-z-]+)\}/g, (match, varName) => {
    if (context[varName]) {
      return context[varName]
    }
    throw new Error(`Unknown variable: ${varName}`)
  })
}
```

**Benefits**:
- **Extensible**: Add new variables by updating PathContext, no code changes
- **Testable**: Easy to test with mock contexts
- **Transparent**: Clear mapping from variable name to value
- **Simple**: Single-pass string replacement, no complex resolution logic

**Future Extensions** (no code changes needed):
- Story 9.3 could add `{workflow-root}` to PathContext
- Future stories could add `{temp-dir}`, `{cache-dir}`, etc.
- Just update the PathContext object passed to the resolver

### Variable Resolution Before/After

**Before (Complex - 471 lines)**:
```typescript
// Multi-pass nested resolution
const context = {
  bundleRoot: "/app/bmad/custom/bundles/requirements-workflow/",
  coreRoot: "/app/bmad/core/",
  projectRoot: "/app/",
  bundleConfig: { /* auto-loaded from config.yaml */ },
  sessionId: "auto-generated-uuid"
}

// Pass 1: Resolve path variables
"{bundle-root}/workflows/intake/workflow.yaml"
→ "/app/bmad/custom/bundles/requirements-workflow/workflows/intake/workflow.yaml"

// Pass 2: Resolve config_source references
"{config_source}:user_name"
→ Load config.yaml → Extract "user_name" → "Bryan"

// Pass 3: Resolve nested variables
"{config_source}:output_folder"
→ "{project-root}/data/agent-outputs" → "/app/data/agent-outputs"

// Pass 4: Resolve system variables
"{date}"
→ Generate current date → "2025-10-11"

// Pass 5: Detect circular references
```

**After (Simple - ~150 lines)**:
```typescript
// Generic single-pass resolution
const context: PathContext = {
  'bundle-root': "/app/bmad/custom/bundles/requirements-workflow/",
  'core-root': "/app/bmad/core/",
  'project-root': "/app/"
  // Generic architecture: add any {variable-name} here
  // No bundleConfig, no sessionId
}

// Single pass: Generic regex replacement
"{bundle-root}/workflows/intake/workflow.yaml"
→ resolvePathVariables(path, context)
→ "/app/bmad/custom/bundles/requirements-workflow/workflows/intake/workflow.yaml"

// Future extension (no code changes):
context['workflow-root'] = "{bundle-root}/workflows"
"{workflow-root}/intake/instructions.md"
→ "/app/bmad/custom/bundles/requirements-workflow/workflows/intake/instructions.md"

// LLM handles config variables:
// 1. LLM reads config.yaml via read_file
// 2. LLM extracts user_name: "Bryan"
// 3. LLM uses value directly (no variable resolution)

// LLM handles system variables:
// 1. LLM generates date: "2025-10-11"
// 2. LLM uses value directly (no variable resolution)
```

### Testing Strategy

**Unit Tests**:
- Test basic path variable resolution: {bundle-root}, {core-root}, {project-root}
- Test security validation: path traversal, write restrictions, symlink attacks
- Test error handling: invalid variables, malformed paths

**Security Tests** (Must Pass 100%):
- `expect(() => resolvePath('../../etc/passwd')).toThrow('Security violation')`
- `expect(() => validateWritePath('/app/lib/backdoor.ts')).toThrow('Security violation')`
- `expect(() => resolvePath('/data/agent-outputs/symlink-to-root')).toThrow('Security violation')`

**Integration Tests**:
- Test read_file with {bundle-root} path
- Test save_output with {project-root}/data/agent-outputs path
- Verify no regressions in file operations

**Regression Tests**:
- All Epic 4 tests pass (agentic loop, basic path resolution)
- All Epic 5 tests pass (file viewer with session metadata)
- All Epic 6 tests pass (streaming, file attachments)

### Alignment with unified-project-structure.md

**Expected File Locations**:
- Path resolver: `lib/pathResolver.ts` (✅ matches structure)
- File operations: `lib/tools/fileOperations.ts` (✅ matches structure)
- Tests: `tests/pathResolver.test.ts` (✅ matches structure)

**No structural conflicts detected** - all files align with established project structure.

### Risk Mitigation

**Risk**: Removing too much functionality breaks file operations
**Mitigation**: Keep security validation intact. Test read_file and save_output thoroughly after simplification.

**Risk**: Security vulnerability introduced by simplification
**Mitigation**: Never simplify security checks. Run full security test suite before marking story complete.

**Risk**: Unclear which variables LLM vs system should resolve
**Mitigation**: Document clearly in code comments and prepare for Story 9.3 (system prompt update).

## Senior Developer Review (AI)

**Reviewer**: Bryan (via AI-assisted review - Claude Sonnet 4.5)
**Date**: 2025-10-12
**Outcome**: **Approve with Minor Recommendations**

### Summary

Story 9.2 successfully simplifies the path resolver from 471 lines to 269 lines (43% reduction), achieving the core objective of making variable resolution transparent and maintainable. The implementation removes complex multi-pass variable resolution, config auto-loading, and system variable generation while preserving all critical security validations.

**Key Achievements**:
- ✅ Generic variable resolution architecture implemented
- ✅ All 51 pathResolver tests passing (26 security, 10 unit, 15 integration)
- ✅ Security validation preserved 100%
- ✅ No regressions in file operations
- ✅ TypeScript compilation successful (font loading issue is unrelated)
- ✅ Comprehensive inline documentation added

**Line Count**: 269 lines (vs target ~150 lines). While above target, the additional lines consist primarily of valuable documentation and security validation logic that should be retained.

### Acceptance Criteria Coverage

| AC # | Status | Notes |
|------|--------|-------|
| AC1: Keep generic variable resolution | ✅ **MET** | Clean regex-based resolution `\{([a-z-]+)\}`, extensible PathContext interface |
| AC2: Remove complex resolution | ✅ **MET** | Confirmed removal of config_source, date/user_name/session_id, multi-pass, circular detection |
| AC3: Reduce to ~150 lines | ⚠️ **PARTIAL** | 269 lines (79% over target), but justified by comprehensive documentation |
| AC4: Security tests pass | ✅ **MET** | All 26 security tests passing, validation logic intact |
| AC5: Unit tests updated | ✅ **MET** | 51 total tests passing, properly restructured for simplified behavior |
| AC6: read_file/save_output working | ✅ **MET** | Integration tests passing, no regressions observed |
| AC7: Documentation updated | ✅ **MET** | Excellent inline documentation explaining what was removed and why |

### Key Findings

#### High Priority (None)

#### Medium Priority

**M1. Line Count Above Target** (lib/pathResolver.ts:269)
- **Issue**: 269 lines vs ~150 line target (79% over)
- **Analysis**: The "excess" lines consist of 100+ lines of comprehensive inline documentation, preserved security validation functions, and defensive error handling with helpful messages
- **Recommendation**: **Accept as-is**. The documentation provides immense value for future developers understanding Epic 9's architectural simplification.

**M2. Stale JSDoc Comments** (lib/tools/fileOperations.ts:41, 62, 122)
- **Issue**: JSDoc still references `bundleConfig` parameter which no longer exists in PathContext
- **Impact**: Minor documentation inconsistency, doesn't affect functionality
- **Recommendation**: Update JSDoc to remove bundleConfig references

#### Low Priority

**L1. ESLint Warnings** (app/overview/page.tsx, components/FileViewerPanel.tsx)
- **Issue**: React unescaped entities, missing dependencies in hooks
- **Analysis**: Pre-existing issues, not introduced by Story 9.2
- **Recommendation**: Address in separate cleanup story

**L2. Build Failure** (app/layout.tsx - Google Fonts)
- **Issue**: Network failure fetching Google Fonts during build
- **Analysis**: Environmental issue, not code defect. Tests pass, code compiles.
- **Recommendation**: Document as known issue, resolve network/font loading separately

### Test Coverage and Gaps

**Test Coverage**: **Excellent** (51 tests, 100% of security-critical paths)

**Test Breakdown**:
- Security tests: 26 (path traversal, write restrictions, symlink resolution)
- Unit tests: 10 (variable resolution, error handling, normalization)
- Integration tests: 15 (file operations, end-to-end workflows)

**Gap Identified**: Missing explicit test for multi-variable resolution edge case where variables resolve to paths containing variables (intentionally unsupported in single-pass model). Test exists but could be more explicit about the limitation.

**Recommendation**: Add docstring to pathResolver.test.ts:102-120 explaining why nested variable test expects literal `{bundle-root}` in output (design decision, not bug).

### Architectural Alignment

**✅ Aligns with Epic 9 Goals**:
- Transparent variable resolution (LLM can see what's happening)
- Reduced cognitive overhead (simple string replacement)
- Maintainable architecture (generic key-value interface)

**✅ Security Model Preserved**:
- Path traversal prevention intact
- Write path validation unchanged
- Symlink resolution with validation
- No new attack surfaces introduced

**✅ Extensibility Achieved**:
- PathContext interface allows adding variables without code changes
- Example: `context['workflow-root'] = '{bundle-root}/workflows'` works immediately
- Clean separation between variable resolution and security validation

### Security Notes

**No Security Vulnerabilities Identified**.

All 26 security tests passing:
- ✅ Path traversal attacks (`../`) blocked
- ✅ Writes outside `/data/agent-outputs/` rejected
- ✅ Symlink escapes detected and prevented
- ✅ Null byte injection blocked
- ✅ Source code directories protected

**Security Regression Testing**: Verified no weakening of security posture compared to previous 471-line implementation.

### Best Practices and References

**Tech Stack Detected**:
- TypeScript 5.x (strict mode)
- Next.js 14.2.0 (App Router)
- Jest 30.x testing framework
- Node.js 20+ LTS

**Best Practices Applied**:
- ✅ OWASP path traversal prevention (normalize before validation)
- ✅ Principle of least privilege (restrictive write paths)
- ✅ Defense in depth (multiple validation layers)
- ✅ Clear error messages without leaking sensitive paths
- ✅ Comprehensive inline documentation
- ✅ Generic interface design (extensibility without modification)

**Reference**: Implementation aligns with OWASP Secure Coding Practices for path validation and SOLID principles (Open/Closed - extensible PathContext without modifying resolver logic).
