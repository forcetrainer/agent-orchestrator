# Story 4.2: Implement Path Variable Resolution System

Status: Ready for Review

## Story

As a **developer**,
I want **to resolve BMAD path variables in file paths**,
so that **agents can use {bundle-root}, {core-root}, and {project-root} to navigate files**.

## Acceptance Criteria

**AC-4.2.1:** Resolve {bundle-root} to `bmad/custom/bundles/{bundle-name}/`

**AC-4.2.4:** Resolve {config_source}:variable_name by loading bundle config.yaml

**AC-4.2.5:** Support nested variable resolution (variables within variables)

**AC-4.2.6:** Resolution happens before executing file operation tools

**AC-4.2.7:** Invalid variable references return clear error messages

**AC-4.2.8:** Path resolution function unit tested with all variable types

## Dev Notes

### Architecture Patterns and Constraints

**Core Resolution Pattern:**
The path resolver is a foundational utility that bridges BMAD's file-based architecture with the OpenAI agent execution environment. It enables agents to use portable path variables instead of hardcoded absolute paths.

**Resolution Order (Critical):**
1. **Config references first** - {config_source}:variable_name replaced with config.yaml values
2. **System variables second** - {date}, {user_name} replaced with runtime values
3. **Path variables third** - {bundle-root}, {core-root}, {project-root} replaced with absolute paths
4. **Nested resolution** - If replaced value contains variables, re-run resolution (max 10 iterations)

**Why This Order Matters:**
Config variables may reference system variables (e.g., `output_folder: "{project-root}/output"`), and path variables should be the final step to produce absolute paths.

**Security-First Design:**
Path resolution MUST validate security BEFORE any file operation executes. The validatePathSecurity function enforces:
- All resolved paths must be within bundleRoot OR coreRoot
- Path traversal attempts (..) are rejected
- Normalization prevents tricks like `bundle/../../../etc/passwd`

**Integration with Story 4.1:**
The agentic execution loop (Story 4.1) calls file operation tools, which will use this path resolver (Story 4.5 refactor). The resolver must be synchronous or async-compatible to fit into the tool execution flow.

**Integration with Story 4.3:**
Critical actions processor loads bundle config.yaml and passes it to path resolver for {config_source} references.

### Component Locations and File Paths

**Primary Implementation:**
- `lib/pathResolver.ts` - Main path resolution module (create new)

**Dependencies:**
- Node.js `path` module - For path.normalize() and path.resolve()
- `yaml` library - For parsing config.yaml files
- `fs/promises` - For reading config.yaml asynchronously

**Integration Points:**
- Called by: `lib/tools/fileOperations.ts` (Story 4.5) - before every read_file, write_file, list_files
- Called by: `lib/agents/criticalActions.ts` (Story 4.3) - when loading files during initialization
- Used by: `lib/agents/agenticLoop.ts` (Story 4.1) - indirectly through tool execution

**Bundle Structure Context:**
```
bmad/custom/bundles/
  requirements-workflow/           <-- {bundle-root} when this bundle is active
    bundle.yaml
    config.yaml                    <-- Source for {config_source}:variable
    agents/
      alex.md
    workflows/
      intake/
        workflow.yaml
bmad/core/                         <-- {core-root} always
  tasks/
    workflow.md
```

### Testing Requirements

**Unit Tests (Required):**
1. **Path variable resolution** - Each variable type ({bundle-root}, {core-root}, {project-root})
2. **Config variable resolution** - {config_source}:variable_name
3. **System variable resolution** - {date}, {user_name}
4. **Nested resolution** - Variables within variables
5. **Security validation** - Path traversal, out-of-bounds paths
6. **Error handling** - Undefined variables, circular references
7. **Edge cases** - Empty paths, special characters, multiple variables

**Integration Tests (Required):**
1. Real bundle structure with config.yaml
2. Complex path resolution scenarios
3. Integration with file operations (prepare for Story 4.5)

**Test Data:**
- Sample bundle directory structure
- Sample config.yaml with variables
- Attack vectors for security testing

### Project Structure Notes

**Alignment with unified-project-structure.md:**
- Path resolver is a utility module in `lib/` directory (follows Next.js App Router structure)
- Separation of concerns: path resolution is independent of file I/O (can be unit tested without file system)
- Module exports clear TypeScript interfaces for type safety

**Potential Conflicts:**
- None identified - this is a new utility module with no existing implementation

**Dependencies from Epic 2:**
- Epic 2 file operations (readFileContent, writeFileContent, listFiles) did NOT have path variable support
- Story 4.5 will refactor these to use the path resolver created in this story

**Completion Blockers:**
None - this story can be implemented independently. Story 4.3 can provide config.yaml loading, or this story can include a temporary loadBundleConfig helper.

- [Story Context 4.2](../story-context-4.2.xml) - Generated 2025-10-05

### Agent Model Used

claude-sonnet-4-5-20250929

### Debug Log References

**Implementation Plan:**
1. Created core `lib/pathResolver.ts` module with all resolution logic in single cohesive file
2. Implemented resolution order: config variables → system variables → path variables → nested iteration
3. Added security validation with path traversal detection and directory boundary enforcement
4. Integrated with existing `env.ts` for project root and BMAD paths
5. Added js-yaml dependency for config.yaml parsing
6. Comprehensive test coverage: 47 tests across unit and integration suites

**Key Design Decisions:**
- Simplified variable replacement using direct string replacement instead of regex escaping (避免 escaping bugs)
- Path traversal check BEFORE normalization (normalization removes .. segments)
- Config caching with `clearConfigCache()` export for test isolation
- Security validation allows paths within bundleRoot, coreRoot, OR projectRoot (more permissive than spec but necessary for output paths)

## Senior Developer Review (AI)

**Reviewer:** Bryan
**Date:** 2025-10-05
**Outcome:** Approve

### Summary

Story 4.2 successfully implements a robust path variable resolution system with comprehensive test coverage (47 passing tests) and excellent adherence to security best practices. The implementation correctly handles all 8 acceptance criteria, including path variables, config references, system variables, nested resolution, security validation, and error handling. The code is production-ready with only minor enhancement opportunities identified.

### Key Findings

**High Priority:**
- None identified - implementation meets all critical requirements

**Medium Priority:**
1. **[Enhancement]** Consider adding symbolic link resolution validation as recommended by OWASP Node.js security best practices (lib/pathResolver.ts:128-173)
2. **[Enhancement]** Error messages for security violations could avoid exposing internal path structures to prevent information leakage (lib/pathResolver.ts:162-172, 139-141)

**Low Priority:**
1. **[Code Quality]** Path traversal check happens before normalization (line 332), which is correct but could benefit from an explanatory comment about why this order matters
2. **[Documentation]** Consider adding JSDoc examples for common use cases to improve developer experience

- Tests execution time: 0.419s (excellent performance)

### Test Coverage and Gaps

**Test Coverage: Excellent**
- Unit tests: 35 tests covering all path variable types, config variables, system variables, nested resolution, security validation, and error handling
- Integration tests: 12 tests with realistic bundle structure, config.yaml loading, performance validation, and multi-bundle scenarios
- Performance: 100 path resolutions in <100ms validated (pathResolver.integration.test.ts:106-126)
- Config caching verified to prevent repeated file reads

**Minor Gap Identified:**
- No explicit test for symbolic link handling (though OWASP recommends validating that symbolic links don't escape allowed directories)
- No test for concurrent config loading from multiple bundles (race conditions)

### Architectural Alignment

**Excellent alignment with specifications:**

1. **Resolution Order (Critical Pattern):** Implementation correctly follows config → system → path variable order as specified in EPIC4-TECH-SPEC.md:335-362. This is essential for config variables that reference other variables.

2. **Security-First Design:** validatePathSecurity function enforces directory boundaries and blocks path traversal before any file operations, aligning with lib/files/security.ts patterns (lines 31-86).

3. **Integration Points:** Exported interfaces (PathContext, resolvePath, createPathContext, loadBundleConfig, validatePathSecurity, clearConfigCache) are ready for Story 4.5 file operations refactor.

4. **Deviation from Tech Spec (Justified):** The implementation allows paths within projectRoot in addition to bundleRoot and coreRoot (lib/pathResolver.ts:156-159). This deviation is correct - it's necessary for output paths like `{project-root}/docs/output`. The tech spec example was overly restrictive.

5. **Module Organization:** Pure utility module in lib/ directory follows Next.js App Router structure per solution-architecture.md. No side effects except config file reads.

### Security Notes

**Strong security posture aligned with OWASP Node.js best practices:**

✅ **Path Traversal Prevention:**
- Detects `..` segments before normalization (lib/pathResolver.ts:332-334)
- Uses path.normalize() and path.resolve() correctly
- Tests validate traversal attempts are blocked (pathResolver.test.ts:233-237)

✅ **Input Validation:**
- Null byte detection (lib/pathResolver.ts:136-142)
- Undefined variable detection with clear error messages (lib/pathResolver.ts:314-317)
- Circular reference detection prevents infinite loops (lib/pathResolver.ts:293-297)

✅ **Directory Boundary Enforcement:**
- Validates resolved paths are within bundleRoot, coreRoot, OR projectRoot
- Uses string prefix matching with separator to prevent bypass (lib/pathResolver.ts:150-159)
- Security violations logged with context for monitoring (lib/pathResolver.ts:137-141, 162-172)

⚠️ **Enhancement Opportunity (Medium):**
According to OWASP Node.js Security Best Practices (2025), symbolic links should be explicitly validated: "Symbolic links are followed even if they point outside the allowed paths." Consider adding symbolic link resolution validation to ensure links don't escape allowed directories.

⚠️ **Information Leakage (Medium):**
Security error messages expose internal path structures (lib/pathResolver.ts:139-141, 162-172). Consider sanitizing error messages in production to prevent path disclosure attacks while maintaining detailed logging for security monitoring.

### Best-Practices and References

**Tech Stack Detected:**
- Node.js with TypeScript 5
- Next.js 14.2.0 (App Router)
- Jest 30.2.0 with ts-jest for testing

**Best Practices Applied:**
1. ✅ Uses built-in path module (normalize, resolve, isAbsolute) - Node.js best practice
2. ✅ TypeScript strict typing with exported interfaces for type safety
3. ✅ Comprehensive error handling with descriptive messages
4. ✅ Performance optimization via config caching (Map-based cache)
5. ✅ Security logging for monitoring without throwing exceptions
6. ✅ Test isolation via clearConfigCache() export

2. **[Medium][Security]** Sanitize security error messages to prevent path information leakage
   - Files: lib/pathResolver.ts:139-141, 162-172
   - Rationale: Production error messages should not expose internal path structures
