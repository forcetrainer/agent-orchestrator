# Tech Spec: Epic 9 - Simplify Workflow Execution Architecture

**Epic:** Epic 9
**Author:** Bryan
**Date:** 2025-10-11
**Status:** In Progress
**Related Documents:**
- `/docs/REFACTOR-SPEC-SIMPLIFY-WORKFLOW-EXECUTION.md` (original specification)
- `/docs/solution-architecture.md`
- `/docs/epics.md`

---

## Executive Summary

Epic 9 refactors the workflow execution system to an LLM-orchestrated pattern, removing over-engineered tool abstractions. The current `execute_workflow` tool (640 lines) does too much "magic" - creating sessions, resolving variables, auto-loading files - without LLM awareness. This creates cognitive overhead and reduces LLM agency.

**Goal**: Give LLM full control over workflow execution through explicit file operations (`read_file`, `save_output`) guided by system prompt instructions.

**Impact**:
- ~580 lines of code removed (execute_workflow + path resolver simplification)
- Improved LLM behavior (simpler tool results)
- Easier debugging (all actions visible in conversation)
- Architecture aligns with Claude Code patterns

---

## Problem Statement

The current workflow execution system is **over-engineered** with too many layers of abstraction between the LLM and file operations. This complexity:

1. **Reduces LLM agency** - The system does work the LLM should orchestrate
2. **Creates cognitive overhead** - Complex tool results confuse the LLM (especially GPT-4)
3. **Makes debugging difficult** - Too many layers (system prompt → workflow.md → execute_workflow → path resolver)
4. **Differs from Claude Code** - Claude Code uses simple file operations, not workflow orchestration engines

---

## Current Architecture (Problems)

### Current Flow
```
User: /run-workflow intake-integration

↓

System: Calls execute_workflow tool (640 lines of code!)
  ↓
  → Reads workflow.yaml
  → Parses YAML
  → Generates UUID session_id
  → Creates session folder
  → Generates manifest.json
  → Resolves variables (5-pass nested resolution)
  → Auto-loads ALL files based on file extensions
  → Updates bundleConfig from loaded files
  → Injects session_folder into context
  → Returns massive object: {
      success, path, workflow_name, description, config,
      user_input, session_id, session_folder,
      instructions, template, config_source, ...
    }

↓

LLM: Receives complex structured object
  → Must parse JSON structure
  → Must understand session management
  → Must figure out which fields are files vs metadata
  → Often confused about what to do next
```

### Key Problems

#### 1. **Removes LLM Agency**
The `execute_workflow` tool does too much "magic":
- Creates session folders (LLM doesn't know where)
- Generates UUIDs (LLM doesn't know when/why)
- Auto-loads files (LLM doesn't request them)
- Resolves variables in 5 passes (LLM never sees the logic)

**Claude Code approach**: LLM decides when to create folders, what files to load, when to ask for variables.

#### 2. **Complex Tool Results**
The tool returns a 10+ field object with mixed concerns:
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "workflow_name": "intake-integration",
  "description": "...",
  "config": { /* 20+ resolved variables */ },
  "session_id": "uuid-here",
  "session_folder": "path/here",
  "instructions": "... 189 lines ...",
  "template": "... 50 lines ...",
  "config_source": "... yaml content ..."
}
```

GPT-4 struggles to parse this. Claude Code just gets: `"file content here"`.

#### 3. **Hidden Session Management**
- Session folders created automatically
- UUIDs generated behind the scenes
- Manifest files written without LLM awareness
- `save_output` uses session_folder context variable

**Result**: When LLM calls `save_output("output.md")`, it magically goes to a session folder the LLM never explicitly created.

#### 4. **Over-Complex Path Resolution**
The path resolver has 471 lines handling:
- 5-pass nested variable resolution
- Config variable references `{config_source}:variable_name`
- System variables `{date}`, `{user_name}`
- Path variables `{bundle-root}`, `{core-root}`, `{project-root}`
- Circular reference detection
- Security validation
- Symlink resolution

**Most of this complexity isn't needed** if the LLM orchestrates variable resolution.

---

## Proposed Architecture (Simple)

### New Flow
```
User: /run-workflow intake-integration

↓

System Prompt instructs LLM:
  "When running a workflow:
   1. Read the workflow.yaml file at {bundle-root}/workflows/{name}/workflow.yaml
   2. Parse it to understand structure
   3. Load any referenced files (instructions, template, config)
   4. Execute the workflow step by step
   5. When saving output, create appropriate folders and files"

↓

LLM: I need to load the workflow configuration
  [Calls read_file with workflow.yaml path]
  [Gets raw YAML content]

LLM: Let me parse this...I see instructions at {bundle-root}/workflows/intake-integration/instructions.md
  [Calls read_file with instructions path]
  [Gets instructions content]

LLM: I also need the template file
  [Calls read_file with template path]
  [Gets template content]

LLM: Now I'll follow the workflow instructions...
  [Executes workflow according to instructions.md]

LLM: Step 8 says to save the final document. Let me create a session folder first.
  [Calls save_output to create session folder and files]
  [Explicit, visible action]
```

### Key Improvements

#### 1. **LLM Has Full Agency**
- LLM decides when to read files
- LLM decides when to create folders
- LLM decides what to name output files
- LLM sees and controls all actions

#### 2. **Simple Tool Results**
```
read_file result:
{
  "success": true,
  "content": "file content here"
}
```

That's it. No complex nested objects.

#### 3. **Explicit Session Management**
System prompt tells LLM:
```markdown
When creating workflow outputs:
1. Generate a session ID (uuid or timestamp)
2. Create folder: /data/agent-outputs/{session-id}/
3. Save files to that folder
4. Create a manifest.json with workflow metadata
```

Everything is explicit and visible in conversation.

#### 4. **Simpler Path Resolution**
Variables resolve in system prompt or by LLM:
- `{bundle-root}` → System prompt provides this as environment variable
- `{config_source}:variable_name` → LLM reads config.yaml first, then uses values
- `{date}` → LLM generates this (or system prompt provides "current date")

## Story Breakdown

**Note:** Story structure updated after Story 9.3 learnings. Original Stories 9.4-9.5 replaced with new Story 9.4 (Smart Workflow Pre-loading).

### Story 9.1: Remove execute_workflow Tool

**As a** developer
**I want** to remove the execute_workflow tool from the codebase
**So that** LLM orchestrates workflow execution instead of hidden tool logic

**Prerequisites:** Epic 6 complete, all existing workflows documented

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. `lib/tools/fileOperations.ts` - Remove `executeWorkflow` function (lines 289-516)
2. `lib/tools/toolDefinitions.ts` - Remove `executeWorkflowTool` export
3. `lib/agents/agenticLoop.ts` - Remove from tool definitions list
4. Only two file operation tools remain: `read_file`, `save_output`
5. All tests referencing execute_workflow removed or updated
6. Code compiles without errors after removal

**Technical Notes:**
- This is destructive - ensure Epic 6 is complete and working before starting
- Document current execute_workflow behavior for reference during migration
- Keep security validation logic (will be reused in simplified path resolver)

---

### Story 9.2: Simplify Path Resolver

**As a** developer
**I want** to simplify the path resolver from 471 lines to ~150 lines
**So that** variable resolution is transparent and maintainable

**Prerequisites:** Story 9.1 (execute_workflow removed)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. **Keep** in `lib/pathResolver.ts`:
   - Basic path resolution for `{bundle-root}`, `{core-root}`, `{project-root}`
   - Security validation (stays within allowed directories)
   - Write path validation (restrict to /data/agent-outputs)
2. **Remove** from `lib/pathResolver.ts`:
   - `{config_source}:variable_name` resolution (LLM handles this by reading config.yaml)
   - `{date}` and `{user_name}` resolution (LLM generates these)
   - `{session_id}` resolution (LLM manages session IDs)
   - Multi-pass nested variable resolution
   - Config file auto-loading and parsing
   - Circular reference detection
3. Path resolver reduced to ~150 lines (68% reduction from 471 lines)
4. All path security tests pass
5. Unit tests updated for simplified resolver

**Technical Notes:**
- Follow refactor spec Section "Phase 3: Simplify Path Resolver"
- Document what was removed and why (LLM now handles these responsibilities)
- Security validation is critical - do not simplify security checks

---

### Story 9.3: Update System Prompt with Workflow Orchestration Instructions

**As a** developer
**I want** to add workflow orchestration instructions to the system prompt
**So that** LLM knows how to load workflows, resolve variables, and manage sessions

**Prerequisites:** Story 9.2 (path resolver simplified)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. Add new section to `lib/agents/prompts/system-prompt.md`: "Running Workflows"
2. Section includes (~80 lines):
   - Step 1: Load Workflow Configuration (call read_file with workflow.yaml path)
   - Step 2: Load Referenced Files (instructions, template, config)
   - Step 3: Load Core Workflow Engine (read bmad/core/tasks/workflow.md)
   - Step 4: Execute Workflow Instructions (follow steps in exact order)
   - Step 5: Session and Output Management (generate UUID, create folders, save files)
   - Variable Resolution rules (bundle-root, project-root, core-root, date, config variables)
3. System prompt emphasizes: "You are in control. Read what you need, when you need it."
4. Examples provided for each step
5. System prompt tested with sample workflow to verify LLM follows instructions

**Technical Notes:**
- Follow refactor spec Section "Phase 2: Update System Prompt for Workflow Orchestration"
- Be explicit and detailed - LLM needs clear instructions
- Test with GPT-4 to ensure instructions are clear

---

### Story 9.4: Implement Smart Workflow Pre-loading (UPDATED)

**Status:** 🎯 IN PROGRESS (~40% Complete)

**As a** developer
**I want** a smart workflow pre-loading system
**So that** LLM receives all workflow files in a single tool call instead of making 4-6 sequential read_file calls

**Prerequisites:** Story 9.3 complete (system prompt v2.4.4)

**Replaces:** Old Stories 9.4 (save_output changes) and 9.5 (update 15 workflow files)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. ✅ Create `lib/workflows/workflowPreloader.ts` module
2. ✅ Implement `preloadWorkflowFiles()` function that loads all workflow files in parallel
3. ⚠️ Add `preload_workflow` tool to toolDefinitions.ts (defined but NOT registered in agenticLoop/chat route)
4. ✅ Parser detects conditional files (`<elicit-required>`, `<invoke-workflow>`)
5. ✅ Tool result includes all file contents with clear "files already loaded" message
6. ❌ System prompt simplified from ~146 lines to ~40 lines for workflow execution
7. ❌ Performance: Workflow initialization <20 seconds (vs ~110s baseline)
8. ❌ Token usage: 50-70% reduction vs sequential loading
9. ❌ No rate limit errors during normal workflow execution
10. ❌ All 15 existing workflows work without modification (backward compatible)

**Implementation Status (2025-10-12):**

✅ **Complete:**
- Core pre-loader module fully implemented
- Tool definition created with proper schema
- Tool executor integration with performance logging
- YAML-internal variable resolution working
- Conditional file loading (elicit task) implemented

❌ **Missing:**
- **CRITICAL**: Tool not registered in `agenticLoop.ts:86-88` or `app/api/chat/route.ts:233-234`
- System prompt not updated to use `preload_workflow` tool
- No unit tests for `workflowPreloader.ts`
- No integration tests or performance benchmarks
- Documentation incomplete (README, tech spec)

**Why This Replaces Old 9.4-9.5:**
- Old 9.4 (save_output changes): Minor, not worth separate story
- Old 9.5 (update 15 workflow files): Unnecessary with smart pre-loading
- New approach: Parser pre-loads → LLM orchestrates → No workflow file changes needed
- Benefits: 3-5x faster, 50-70% token reduction, no rate limits, avoids error-prone 15-file migration

**Detailed Spec:** `/docs/stories/story-9.4.md`

---

### Story 9.6: End-to-End Validation and Documentation

**As a** developer
**I want** to validate that all workflows produce identical outputs with new architecture
**So that** we confirm the refactor is successful and document the new patterns

**Prerequisites:** All Epic 9 stories 9.1-9.4 complete (Note: Stories 9.5 was replaced by updated Story 9.4)

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. **Validation Testing**:
   - Run at least 3 different workflows (one from Alex, Casey, Pixel bundles)
   - Compare outputs to baseline from old architecture
   - Verify identical functionality (same files created, same content)
   - Verify session folders created correctly
   - Verify manifest.json generated
2. **Performance Testing**:
   - Measure workflow execution time (should be similar or faster)
   - Verify no performance regressions
3. **Documentation Updates**:
   - Update `docs/solution-architecture.md` with new architecture (remove execute_workflow, add LLM orchestration section)
   - Create `docs/WORKFLOW-MIGRATION-GUIDE.md` explaining old vs new pattern
   - Update `docs/tech-spec-epic-9.md` (if creating separate tech spec)
4. **Code Cleanup**:
   - Remove all dead code related to execute_workflow
   - Update comments referencing old architecture
   - ESLint clean, no warnings
5. **Success Metrics Validated**:
   - ✅ LLM orchestrates all workflow steps explicitly
   - ✅ Tool results are simple (no complex nested objects)
   - ✅ Path resolver reduced to ~150 lines
   - ✅ execute_workflow tool removed
   - ✅ All workflows produce identical outputs

**Technical Notes:**
- This is the validation story - thorough testing before moving to Epic 7
- Create baseline outputs from old architecture for comparison
- Document any differences discovered (should be none)
- If issues found, fix before marking Epic 9 complete

## Files Affected

### Modified Files
1. ✅ `lib/tools/fileOperations.ts` - Remove executeWorkflow (~228 lines removed) - Story 9.1
2. ✅ `lib/tools/toolDefinitions.ts` - Remove executeWorkflowTool (~30 lines removed) - Story 9.1
3. ✅ `lib/agents/agenticLoop.ts` - Remove execute_workflow from tools list (~5 lines) - Story 9.1
4. ✅ `lib/pathResolver.ts` - Simplify variable resolution (~250 lines removed) - Story 9.2
5. ✅ `lib/agents/prompts/system-prompt.md` - Add workflow orchestration section (146 lines added) - Story 9.3
6. ✅ `lib/agents/criticalActions.ts` - Add config as environment variable (~20 lines modified) - Story 9.3
7. ✅ `lib/workflows/workflowPreloader.ts` - NEW: Smart pre-loading module (220 lines) - Story 9.4
8. ⚠️ `lib/tools/toolDefinitions.ts` - Add preloadWorkflowTool (partial - not registered) - Story 9.4
9. ✅ `lib/tools/toolExecutor.ts` - Add preload_workflow case handler (~43 lines) - Story 9.4

### Files to Update (Workflow Instructions)
**OBSOLETE** - Story 9.4 smart pre-loading eliminates the need for workflow file updates.

~~All `bmad/custom/bundles/requirements-workflow/workflows/*/instructions.md` files (15 files)~~ - NO LONGER NEEDED

**New approach:** Parser pre-loads all files → LLM orchestrates → No workflow changes required

---

## Expected Benefits

### 1. **Improved LLM Behavior**
- LLM understands what it's doing (explicit actions)
- Better adherence to workflow steps (less confusion)
- Works better with GPT-4 (simpler tool results)

### 2. **Easier Debugging**
- All actions visible in conversation
- Fewer abstraction layers
- Clear cause-and-effect relationships

### 3. **Maintainability**
- ~580 lines of code removed
- Simpler mental model
- Easier onboarding for new developers

### 4. **Flexibility**
- LLM can adapt workflows on the fly
- Easier to handle edge cases
- User can intervene at any step

### 5. **Closer to Claude Code**
- Matches proven architecture
- Easier to understand for users familiar with Claude Code
- Can copy patterns from Claude Code docs

---

## Risks and Mitigations

### Risk 1: LLM Forgets Steps
**Risk**: Without auto-orchestration, LLM might skip workflow initialization steps

**Mitigation**:
- Workflow instructions explicitly list all steps
- System prompt emphasizes "execute steps in exact order"
- workflow.md mandates "follow all steps"

### Risk 2: Session Folder Naming Inconsistency
**Risk**: LLM might create session folders with different naming patterns

**Mitigation**:
- System prompt provides explicit format: `{session-id}`
- Workflow instructions show example format
- Session ID validation in save_output tool

### Risk 3: Variable Resolution Errors
**Risk**: LLM might not resolve variables correctly

**Mitigation**:
- System prompt provides clear variable resolution rules
- Path resolver still handles `{bundle-root}`, `{project-root}`, `{core-root}`
- LLM can ask user if variable is unclear

### Risk 4: Increased Token Usage
**Risk**: Multiple read_file calls increase token usage vs single execute_workflow

**Mitigation**:
- Token cost is negligible compared to improved behavior
- Can optimize by loading files lazily (only when needed)
- Modern models have large context windows

---

## Success Criteria

### Must Have
1. All existing workflows produce identical output files
2. Session folder structure remains consistent
3. No security vulnerabilities introduced
4. All tests pass

### Should Have
1. LLM demonstrates better step adherence (measured by manual testing)
2. Debugging is easier (measured by time to diagnose issues)
3. Code is simpler (measured by line count reduction)

### Nice to Have
1. Works well with Claude API (if switching from GPT-4)
2. Users report improved agent behavior
3. Faster execution time (fewer complex operations)

---

## Detailed Design

### Services and Modules

| Service/Module | Responsibility | Inputs | Outputs | Owner |
|----------------|----------------|--------|---------|-------|
| **Path Resolver (Simplified)** | Resolves basic path variables and enforces security | File path with `{bundle-root}`, `{core-root}`, `{project-root}` | Resolved absolute path | Backend |
| **read_file Tool** | Reads file contents from allowed directories | `{ path: string }` | `{ success: boolean, content?: string, error?: string }` | Backend |
| **save_output Tool** | Saves file contents to output directory with security validation | `{ path: string, content: string }` | `{ success: boolean, path?: string, error?: string }` | Backend |
| **System Prompt Builder** | Constructs system prompt with workflow orchestration instructions | Agent metadata, bundle config | Complete system prompt string | Backend |
| **Agentic Loop** | Manages tool execution with simplified tool set | User message, conversation history, tools | LLM response with tool results | Backend |

**Key Architectural Changes:**
- **Removed**: executeWorkflow tool (640 lines) - workflow orchestration now handled by LLM following system prompt instructions
- **Simplified**: Path resolver from 471 lines to ~150 lines - removed multi-pass nested resolution, config auto-loading, and complex variable types
- **Simplified**: save_output tool - removed session folder auto-prepending logic
- **Added**: Workflow orchestration instructions in system prompt (~80 lines)

### Data Models and Contracts

#### Read File Tool Request/Response
```typescript
// Request
interface ReadFileRequest {
  path: string  // May contain {bundle-root}, {core-root}, {project-root}
}

// Response
interface ReadFileResponse {
  success: boolean
  content?: string        // File contents (text only, ~1MB limit)
  path?: string          // Resolved absolute path
  error?: string         // Error message if failed
}
```

#### Save Output Tool Request/Response
```typescript
// Request
interface SaveOutputRequest {
  path: string           // MUST be full path including /data/agent-outputs/{session-id}/
  content: string        // File contents to save
}

// Response
interface SaveOutputResponse {
  success: boolean
  path?: string         // Resolved absolute path where file was saved
  error?: string        // Error message if failed (e.g., security violation, disk full)
}
```

#### Path Resolution Context
```typescript
interface PathContext {
  bundleRoot: string      // e.g., /app/bmad/custom/bundles/{bundle-name}/
  coreRoot: string        // e.g., /app/bmad/core/
  projectRoot: string     // e.g., /app/
  sessionId?: string      // Generated by LLM, not auto-injected
}
```

**Key Change**: SessionId no longer auto-injected into context. LLM manages session IDs explicitly.

### APIs and Interfaces

#### Tool Function Signatures

**read_file Tool**
```typescript
/**
 * Reads file contents from allowed directories (bundle, core, output)
 * Path variables resolved: {bundle-root}, {core-root}, {project-root}
 */
async function readFile(args: ReadFileRequest, context: PathContext): Promise<ReadFileResponse>
```

**save_output Tool**
```typescript
/**
 * Saves file contents to output directory (/data/agent-outputs/)
 * Security: Path MUST resolve to within /data/agent-outputs/
 * LLM must provide full path including session folder
 */
async function saveOutput(args: SaveOutputRequest, context: PathContext): Promise<SaveOutputResponse>
```

**Path Resolver (Simplified)**
```typescript
/**
 * Resolves basic path variables only
 * Removed: {config_source}:variable_name, {date}, {user_name}, {session_id}
 * LLM handles these by reading config files and generating values
 */
function resolvePathVariables(path: string, context: PathContext): string
```

#### System Prompt Additions

**New Section: Workflow Orchestration (~80 lines)**
```markdown
## Running Workflows

When a user requests a workflow execution (e.g., /run-workflow intake-integration):

### Step 1: Load Workflow Configuration
Call `read_file` with the workflow.yaml path: `{bundle-root}/workflows/{workflow-name}/workflow.yaml`
Parse the YAML to understand the workflow structure.

### Step 2: Load Referenced Files
Based on workflow.yaml, load:
- Instructions file (e.g., `{bundle-root}/workflows/{workflow-name}/instructions.md`)
- Template file (if specified)
- Config file (if specified, e.g., `{bundle-root}/config.yaml`)

### Step 3: Load Core Workflow Engine
Read `{core-root}/tasks/workflow.md` for workflow execution rules.

### Step 4: Session and Output Management
- Generate a session ID: Use UUID v4 or timestamp format `YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS`
- Create session folder: `/data/agent-outputs/{session-id}/`
- Throughout workflow execution, save files to this session folder

### Step 5: Execute Workflow Instructions
Follow the instructions file step-by-step in exact order.

### Variable Resolution Rules
- `{bundle-root}` → Provided by system (your agent's bundle folder)
- `{core-root}` → Provided by system (bmad/core/)
- `{project-root}` → Provided by system (app root)
- Config variables (e.g., `{config_source}:user_name`) → Read config file, extract value
- Date/timestamp → Generate current date in required format
- Session ID → You generate this in Step 4
```

### Workflows and Sequencing

#### Current Workflow Execution (Before Epic 9)
```
sequenceDiagram
    User->>Agent: /run-workflow intake-integration
    Agent->>execute_workflow: Call tool with workflow name
    execute_workflow->>FileSystem: Read workflow.yaml
    execute_workflow->>FileSystem: Auto-load instructions, template, config
    execute_workflow->>PathResolver: Resolve variables (5-pass nested)
    execute_workflow->>FileSystem: Create session folder (auto)
    execute_workflow->>Agent: Return complex object with 10+ fields
    Agent->>Agent: Parse complex result
    Agent->>workflow.md: Execute steps with pre-loaded files
    Agent->>save_output: Save file (session folder auto-prepended)
```

#### New Workflow Execution (After Epic 9)
```
sequenceDiagram
    User->>Agent: /run-workflow intake-integration
    Agent->>read_file: Read workflow.yaml
    read_file-->>Agent: { success: true, content: "yaml..." }
    Agent->>Agent: Parse YAML
    Agent->>read_file: Read instructions.md
    read_file-->>Agent: { success: true, content: "instructions..." }
    Agent->>read_file: Read template.md
    read_file-->>Agent: { success: true, content: "template..." }
    Agent->>read_file: Read config.yaml
    read_file-->>Agent: { success: true, content: "config..." }
    Agent->>Agent: Generate session ID (uuid)
    Agent->>save_output: Create session folder /data/agent-outputs/{uuid}/
    Agent->>read_file: Read workflow.md from core
    read_file-->>Agent: { success: true, content: "workflow engine..." }
    Agent->>Agent: Execute workflow steps 1-N
    Agent->>save_output: Save output.md to session folder
    save_output-->>Agent: { success: true, path: "/data/agent-outputs/{uuid}/output.md" }
```

**Key Difference**: All actions are explicit read_file/save_output calls visible in conversation, not hidden in execute_workflow magic.

---

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Performance

**Target Metrics:**
- Workflow execution time: ≤ +10% compared to current architecture (acceptable trade-off for improved LLM behavior)
- Tool response time: read_file ≤ 200ms, save_output ≤ 500ms (unchanged)
- Path resolution: ≤ 5ms (reduced from ~20ms due to simplification)
- Token usage: +15-30% per workflow due to multiple read_file calls (acceptable with modern models)

**Rationale from Architecture:**
- Simpler path resolver reduces CPU overhead
- Multiple read_file calls add network round-trips but improve debugging
- Trade-off: Slightly more tokens, significantly better LLM behavior

**Performance Measurement:**
```typescript
// Benchmark before Epic 9
const baseline = measureWorkflowExecution('intake-integration')

// Benchmark after Epic 9
const newArchitecture = measureWorkflowExecution('intake-integration')

// Acceptable if: newArchitecture.time <= baseline.time * 1.10
```

### Security

**Path Security (CRITICAL):**
1. **Read Security**:
   - Allowed read paths: `{bundle-root}/*`, `{core-root}/*`, `/data/agent-outputs/*`
   - Blocked: All other paths (especially `/app/lib`, `/app/node_modules`, `/etc`, `/root`)
   - Validation: Path traversal attacks (`../`) rejected

2. **Write Security**:
   - **ONLY** writable location: `/data/agent-outputs/`
   - All other paths rejected with security error
   - Session folder validation: Must match pattern `/data/agent-outputs/{uuid}/`

3. **Variable Resolution Security**:
   - `{bundle-root}`, `{core-root}`, `{project-root}` resolved by system (not user input)
   - Path validation after variable resolution
   - Symlink resolution with validation

**Security Tests (Must Pass):**
```typescript
// Path traversal attacks
expect(() => readFile({ path: '../../etc/passwd' })).toThrow('Security violation')
expect(() => saveOutput({ path: '../../app/lib/malicious.ts' })).toThrow('Security violation')

// Write to source code directories
expect(() => saveOutput({ path: '/app/lib/backdoor.ts' })).toThrow('Security violation')

// Symlink escapes
expect(() => readFile({ path: '/data/agent-outputs/symlink-to-root' })).toThrow('Security violation')
```

### Reliability/Availability

**Error Handling:**
1. **File Operation Failures**:
   - File not found: Return clear error with file path (not stack trace)
   - Permission denied: Return security error (don't leak path info)
   - Disk full: Return resource error with guidance

2. **LLM Execution Failures**:
   - If LLM skips workflow initialization step: Workflow instructions include explicit checklist
   - If LLM forgets to create session folder: save_output validates path structure and returns helpful error
   - If LLM uses wrong variable format: read_file/save_output returns clear variable resolution error

3. **Graceful Degradation**:
   - If workflow.yaml malformed: Return parse error with line number
   - If required file missing: Return error with list of available files
   - If session folder creation fails: Return error with suggested recovery action

**Failure Recovery:**
```typescript
// Example: LLM forgets to create session folder
LLM: saveOutput({ path: "output.md", content: "..." })  // Missing session folder!
Tool: { success: false, error: "Invalid path: Must save to /data/agent-outputs/{session-id}/ folder. Create session folder first." }
LLM: [Recovers] Let me create the session folder first...
```

### Observability

**Logging Requirements:**
1. **Tool Execution Logs**:
   ```
   [INFO] read_file: {bundle-root}/workflows/intake-integration/workflow.yaml
   [INFO] Path resolved to: /app/bmad/custom/bundles/requirements-workflow/workflows/intake-integration/workflow.yaml

## Dependencies and Integrations

### Internal Dependencies

| Dependency | Version | Reason | Impact if Removed |
|------------|---------|--------|-------------------|
| `lib/pathResolver.ts` (simplified) | Epic 9 | Basic path variable resolution and security validation | read_file/save_output cannot resolve {bundle-root}, {core-root}, {project-root} |
| `lib/tools/toolDefinitions.ts` | Existing | Tool schema definitions for OpenAI function calling | Agentic loop cannot expose tools to LLM |
| `lib/agents/agenticLoop.ts` | Epic 4 | Manages LLM tool execution loop | Workflow execution fails (no tool orchestration) |
| System Prompt (`lib/agents/prompts/system-prompt.md`) | Epic 9 | Instructions for LLM workflow orchestration | LLM doesn't know how to run workflows |

### External Dependencies

| Dependency | Version | Purpose | Constraints |
|------------|---------|---------|-------------|
| OpenAI SDK | 4.28.0 | LLM API with function calling | Requires function calling support (GPT-4, GPT-4-turbo) |
| Node.js fs/promises | Built-in | File system operations | Requires Node.js 20+ LTS |
| yaml (npm) | 2.3.x | Parse workflow.yaml files (if needed) | LLM can parse YAML as text, this is optional |
| uuid (npm) | 9.0.x | Generate session IDs (optional, LLM can generate) | Can use timestamp format instead |

**Key Change**: No longer depend on complex YAML parsing in tool code - LLM can parse YAML from text content.

### Integration Points

**1. File System Integration**
- **Read Operations**: Bundle folders, core folders, output folders
- **Write Operations**: Only `/data/agent-outputs/` directory
- **Security Boundary**: Path validator enforces allowed directories

**2. OpenAI API Integration**
- **Tool Definitions**: Only `read_file` and `save_output` exposed to LLM
- **Tool Results**: Simple JSON structures (not complex nested objects)
- **Function Calling**: Standard OpenAI function calling protocol (unchanged)

**3. Workflow Engine Integration**
- **Before**: execute_workflow tool loaded and orchestrated workflow execution
- **After**: LLM reads `{core-root}/tasks/workflow.md` and follows instructions directly
- **Migration**: Workflow instructions updated to make session management explicit

**4. System Prompt Integration**
- **New Section**: Workflow orchestration instructions (~80 lines)
- **Variable Resolution**: System prompt explains which variables LLM vs system resolves
- **Examples**: System prompt includes workflow execution examples

## Risks, Assumptions, Open Questions

### Risks

| Risk | Impact | Likelihood | Mitigation | Owner |
|------|--------|-----------|------------|-------|
| **LLM Forgets Workflow Initialization Steps** | High (sessions not created, outputs fail) | Medium | Workflow instructions include explicit Step 0 checklist; system prompt emphasizes "execute steps in exact order"; workflow.md mandates step adherence | Bryan |
| **Session Folder Naming Inconsistency** | Medium (hard to find outputs, naming confusion) | Medium | System prompt provides explicit session ID format (uuid or timestamp); save_output validates session folder structure | Bryan |
| **Variable Resolution Errors** | Medium (file not found, path errors) | Low | System prompt includes clear variable resolution rules; path resolver still handles basic variables; LLM can ask user if unclear | Bryan |
| **Increased Token Usage** | Low (higher OpenAI costs) | High | Acceptable trade-off for improved LLM behavior; modern models have large context windows; can optimize by lazy loading | Bryan |
| **Regression in Workflow Outputs** | High (outputs differ from baseline) | Low | End-to-end validation (Story 9.6) compares outputs to baseline before marking epic complete; fix any differences | Bryan |
| **Security Vulnerability** | Critical (data breach, source code modification) | Low | Security validation remains in path resolver; extensive security tests; no changes to security model | Bryan |

### Assumptions

| Assumption | Validation | Impact if Wrong |
|------------|-----------|-----------------|
| LLM can reliably parse YAML from text content | Test with GPT-4 during Story 9.3 | May need to add YAML parser utility function |
| LLM will follow explicit step-by-step instructions in system prompt | Validate with sample workflows in Story 9.6 | May need more prescriptive system prompt or add validation checkpoints |
| 15 workflow instruction files can be updated consistently | Create template and use careful find/replace in Story 9.5 | Inconsistent updates may cause some workflows to fail |
| ~580 lines of code removal doesn't break edge cases | Comprehensive testing in Story 9.6 | May discover edge cases that relied on complex path resolution |
| Token cost increase is acceptable | Monitor token usage in Story 9.6 | May need to optimize by reducing redundant file reads |

### Open Questions

| Question | Answer Needed By | Decision Maker | Impact |
|----------|------------------|----------------|--------|
| Should we keep YAML parsing library or rely on LLM text parsing? | Story 9.2 (Path Resolver) | Bryan | Determines if we keep `yaml` npm dependency |
| Should session ID format be UUID or timestamp (YYYY-MM-DD-HHMMSS)? | Story 9.3 (System Prompt) | Bryan | Affects readability vs collision-resistance |
| Do we need to support legacy session folders created by old architecture? | Story 9.6 (Validation) | Bryan | Determines if migration script needed |
| Should we add explicit validation checkpoint after LLM loads workflow files? | Story 9.3 (System Prompt) | Bryan | Trade-off: Safety vs flexibility |
| Can we remove `uuid` npm dependency and use timestamp format only? | Story 9.5 (Workflow Instructions) | Bryan | Simplifies dependencies, may increase collision risk |

## Test Strategy Summary

### Test Levels

**1. Unit Tests**
- **Path Resolver**: Test variable resolution, security validation, write path restrictions
  - Test Cases: bundle-root resolution, security rejections, symlink validation
  - Coverage Target: 100% of security-critical code paths

- **read_file Tool**: Test file loading, path resolution, error handling
  - Test Cases: Valid paths, path traversal attempts, file not found, large files
  - Coverage Target: 90%+

- **save_output Tool**: Test file writing, security validation, session folder validation
  - Test Cases: Valid writes, security violations, disk full, invalid session folder format
  - Coverage Target: 95%+ (security-critical)

**2. Integration Tests**
- **Workflow Execution Flow**: Test complete workflow from LLM read_file calls through save_output
  - Test Cases: Load workflow.yaml → parse → load files → execute steps → save outputs
  - Scenarios: Alex workflow, Casey workflow, Pixel workflow

- **Security Integration**: Test that security validation works across tool chain
  - Test Cases: Path traversal through multiple tools, symlink attacks, write to source code directories

**3. End-to-End Tests (Story 9.6)**
- **Baseline Comparison**: Run workflows with new architecture, compare outputs to old architecture
  - Workflows: intake-integration (Alex), deep-dive-workflow (Casey), build-stories (Pixel)
  - Validation: File content matches, session structure correct, manifest.json generated

- **LLM Behavior Testing**: Verify LLM follows system prompt instructions
  - Test Cases: LLM creates session folder, LLM resolves variables correctly, LLM follows workflow steps

**4. Performance Tests**
- **Execution Time**: Measure workflow execution duration (target: ≤ +10% vs baseline)
- **Token Usage**: Measure token consumption per workflow (expect +15-30%, acceptable)
- **Path Resolution**: Measure path resolver speed (expect improvement due to simplification)

### Edge Cases to Test

1. **LLM Skips Session Initialization**
   - Scenario: LLM tries to save output before creating session folder
   - Expected: save_output returns error with guidance, LLM recovers

2. **Malformed Workflow.yaml**
   - Scenario: YAML syntax error in workflow configuration
   - Expected: LLM receives parse error, can request help from user

3. **Missing Referenced Files**
   - Scenario: Workflow.yaml references instructions.md but file doesn't exist
   - Expected: read_file returns clear "file not found" error with available files list

4. **Concurrent Workflow Executions**
   - Scenario: Two workflows running simultaneously with different session IDs
   - Expected: No collision, outputs isolated in separate session folders

5. **Session Folder Already Exists**
   - Scenario: LLM generates session ID that already exists
   - Expected: Error with suggestion to generate new UUID

### Regression Tests

**Before marking Epic 9 complete:**
1. All Epic 4 tests pass (agentic loop, path resolution basics)
2. All Epic 5 tests pass (file viewer with session metadata)
3. All Epic 6 tests pass (streaming, file attachments, smart session display)
4. Security test suite passes (no new vulnerabilities introduced)
5. All 15 workflows produce outputs identical to baseline

### Test Automation

**Continuous Integration:**
```bash
# Run before each commit
npm run test:unit         # Unit tests (path resolver, tools)
npm run test:integration  # Integration tests (workflow flow, security)
npm run test:e2e          # End-to-end tests (Story 9.6 baseline comparison)
npm run lint              # Code quality checks
```
