## AC Group 1: Visual Streaming Behavior (AC #1-2)

### AC #1: Token Display

| Criterion | Status | Implementation | Notes |
|-----------|--------|----------------|-------|
| Agent text responses appear progressively token-by-token | ✅ PASS | `useStreamingChat.ts:186-209` processes token events, accumulates content | Tokens streamed from `/api/chat` via SSE |
| Tokens render within 100ms of receipt from API | ✅ PASS | Token batching: 16ms window (Task 6) | 16ms << 100ms requirement |
| Markdown formatting updates dynamically as content streams | ✅ PASS | `MessageBubble.tsx:70-129` ReactMarkdown with partial content | React reconciliation handles progressive updates |
| Cursor/indicator shows streaming is active | ✅ PASS | `MessageBubble.tsx:140-142` blinking cursor ▋ | Only shown when `streaming` prop is true |

**Overall AC #1:** ✅ PASS

---

### AC #2: Status Indicators During Streaming

| Criterion | Status | Implementation | Notes |
|-----------|--------|----------------|-------|
| "Agent is thinking..." displays during initial LLM inference (before first token) | ✅ PASS | `useStreamingChat.ts:147`, `MessageList.tsx:96-98` | Shows when `isStreaming && !streamingContent` |
| Status remains visible until first token arrives | ✅ PASS | Status cleared by first token event | Verified in manual testing |
| Status indicators pause streaming to show tool execution | ✅ PASS | `route.ts:303-307` emits status events during tool calls | "Reading X...", "Writing Y..." |
| Text streaming resumes after tool execution completes | ✅ PASS | `route.ts:309-323` agentic loop continues after tool execution | Tool results injected, loop resumes |

**Overall AC #2:** ✅ PASS

---

## AC Group 2: Preserved Functionality - CRITICAL (AC #3-7)

### AC #3: Agentic Execution Loop Preserved

| Criterion | Status | Implementation | Notes |
|-----------|--------|----------------|-------|
| Tool calls from LLM pause streaming | ✅ PASS | `route.ts:249-287` accumulates tool_calls, pauses token streaming | Streaming only occurs for delta.content |
| Tool execution completes before streaming resumes | ✅ PASS | `route.ts:309-319` executes tools synchronously in loop | `await executeToolCall(...)` blocks |
| Tool results inject into conversation context (existing pattern) | ✅ PASS | `route.ts:314-319` pushes tool message to `completeMessages` | Same pattern as agenticLoop.ts |
| LLM continues with tool results available | ✅ PASS | Loop continues with `completeMessages` containing tool result | Next iteration has full context |
| Loop iterates until final response (no tool calls) | ✅ PASS | `route.ts:215-350` while loop continues until no tool_calls | Same as agenticLoop.ts |
| Maximum iteration safety limit still enforced | ✅ PASS | `route.ts:211-212` MAX_ITERATIONS=50 | Prevents infinite loops |

**Overall AC #3:** ✅ PASS

### AC #4: Workflow Handling Preserved

| Criterion | Status | Implementation | Notes |
|-----------|--------|----------------|-------|
| Workflow files load via read_file tool calls (pause streaming) | ✅ PASS | `route.ts:400-408` executeReadFile handles workflow loading | Tool execution blocks streaming |
| Lazy-loading instruction pattern works correctly | ⚠️ NEEDS TESTING | Depends on existing agenticLoop pattern | Manual testing verified, automated test needed |
| Path variable resolution ({bundle-root}, {core-root}, etc.) functions | ✅ PASS | `route.ts:200-207` pathContext includes bundleRoot, coreRoot, projectRoot | Same as agenticLoop.ts |
| Critical-actions execute during agent initialization | ✅ PASS | `route.ts:177-189` processCriticalActions called before streaming | Same timing as agenticLoop.ts |
| Multi-step workflows complete successfully | ⚠️ NEEDS TESTING | Depends on existing workflow execution | Manual testing verified, automated test needed |

**Overall AC #4:** ⚠️ PASS (pending automated tests)

---

### AC #5: Tool Execution Preserved

| Criterion | Status | Implementation | Notes |
|-----------|--------|----------------|-------|
| read_file: Loads content, injects into context, streaming pauses/resumes | ✅ PASS | `route.ts:400-408` executeReadFile | Manual testing verified |
| write_file: Creates files, preserves directory structure, streaming pauses/resumes | ⚠️ NEEDS TESTING | `route.ts:411-418` executeSaveOutput | Not manually tested yet |
| list_files: Returns directory contents, streaming pauses/resumes | ⚠️ NEEDS TESTING | Tool not used in manual tests | Implementation exists |
| All tool calls block streaming until execution complete | ✅ PASS | `route.ts:309-323` await blocks loop iteration | Verified by design |

**Overall AC #5:** ⚠️ PASS (pending comprehensive testing)

---

### AC #6: Status and UI Preserved

| Criterion | Status | Implementation | Notes |
|-----------|--------|----------------|-------|

| Error messages display clearly on failures | ✅ PASS | `useStreamingChat.ts:221-227` processes error events | Manual testing verified |
| Chat auto-scrolls to show streaming content | ⚠️ NEEDS TESTING | Depends on MessageList scroll behavior | Visual verification needed |

**Overall AC #6:** ✅ PASS (auto-scroll needs visual test)

---

### AC #7: Conversation Management Preserved

| Criterion | Status | Implementation | Notes |
|-----------|--------|----------------|-------|
| Message history maintains correct order | ✅ PASS | ChatPanel manages messages array | Manual testing verified |
| File attachments inject into context correctly | ⚠️ NEEDS TESTING | `route.ts:80-120` file attachment logic preserved | Not tested with streaming yet |
| Multi-turn conversations work with streaming | ✅ PASS | ConversationId event added (critical bug fix) | Manual testing verified |
| Session state persists correctly | ✅ PASS | `route.ts:68-78, 129-131, 344-347` session management | Manual testing verified |

**Overall AC #7:** ✅ PASS (file attachments need test)

---

## AC Group 3: Error Handling (AC #8)

### AC #8: Streaming-Specific Errors

| Criterion | Status | Implementation | Notes |
|-----------|--------|----------------|-------|
| Connection drops mid-stream → Show reconnection message, auto-retry | ⚠️ PARTIAL | `useStreamingChat.ts:241-254` catches errors, displays message | Auto-retry not implemented (future enhancement) |
| OpenAI API error during streaming → Display user-friendly error, stop gracefully | ✅ PASS | `route.ts:358-365` emits error event | Frontend displays error, halts streaming |
| Tool execution error during streaming → Show error, halt streaming, display error message | ⚠️ NEEDS TESTING | Tool errors returned as {success: false, error: "..."} | LLM receives error, can retry or inform user |
| Timeout errors handled gracefully (60s max streaming connection) | ⚠️ NEEDS TESTING | Platform-dependent timeout | Not explicitly tested |

**Overall AC #8:** ⚠️ PARTIAL (auto-retry not implemented, timeout not tested)
