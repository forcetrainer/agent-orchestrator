# Product Brief: Agent Orchestrator

**Date:** 2025-10-01
**Author:** Bryan
**Status:** Draft for PM Review

---

## Executive Summary

**Agent Orchestrator** is a lightweight web platform that enables BMAD agent builders to test OpenAI API compatibility and deploy agents to end users. Built with Next.js and designed around BMAD's file-based architecture, it bridges the gap between agent development in Claude Code and production deployment for non-technical users.

**The Problem:** Agent builders can create sophisticated BMAD agents in Claude Code, but these agents are trapped in the IDE with no way to test OpenAI compatibility or deploy to end users. Platform-level agents (ServiceNow, Copilot Studio) can't handle complex instruction sets or human-in-the-loop guidance scenarios. Multiple ready-to-deploy use cases are blocked by lack of a simple deployment platform.

**The Solution:** A ChatGPT-style web interface where agent builders upload BMAD agent files and immediately make them functional via OpenAI API. The platform uses function calling to replicate Claude Code's file operations, preserves BMAD's lazy-loading pattern, and provides end users with a familiar chat experience. Docker deployment enables local/network access without enterprise complexity.

**Target Market:**
- **Primary:** IT professionals (BAs, developers, engineers) building complex guidance agents that exceed platform-level capabilities
- **Secondary:** Non-technical end users who need expert-level assistance through familiar chat interfaces

**Key Value Proposition:** The first and only platform designed specifically for BMAD agents - validating OpenAI compatibility, enabling rapid deployment (under 1 hour for simple agents), and preserving BMAD's radical simplicity without databases, authentication, or complex configuration.

## Problem Statement

Agent builders can create sophisticated BMAD agents using Claude Code, but these agents are trapped in the IDE. There is currently **no platform to test agents with OpenAI or deploy them for end users** - the intended audience of non-technical users who will never touch a CLI or IDE.

**Current State Pain Points:**

- **Technical Validation Gap:** No way to test whether BMAD agents built in Claude Code will work properly with OpenAI's API - the builder has no idea if their agents will function correctly until they have a testing platform
- **Deployment Gap:** Builders have ready-to-deploy use cases but no way to make agents accessible to end users
- **API Compatibility Unknown:** Agents designed in Claude Code may behave differently with OpenAI's function calling and instruction following - this needs immediate validation
- **Collaboration Barrier:** Cannot share working agents with stakeholders, clients, or end users for feedback and validation
- **Platform Lock-in:** Agents only work in Claude Code CLI, limiting their utility to developers only

**Why Existing Solutions Fall Short:**

Existing agent orchestration platforms either:
1. **High Cost:** Enterprise platforms with expensive per-seat or per-conversation pricing models
2. **High Complexity:** Require extensive configuration, infrastructure setup, or custom development that undermines the simplicity and elegance of BMAD's file-based agent design
3. **No BMAD Support:** Don't understand BMAD's file-based architecture and lazy-loading instruction pattern

**Urgency:**

Multiple use cases are **ready for immediate deployment** but blocked by two critical unknowns:
1. **Technical:** Do BMAD agents work with OpenAI API? (needs immediate validation)
2. **Deployment:** How to make agents accessible to non-technical end users?

Without this tool, valuable agents remain untested and unused by their intended audience, and the BMAD methodology cannot demonstrate its full potential beyond developer tooling.

---

## Proposed Solution

**Core Approach:**

Agent Orchestrator is a lightweight, web-based platform that bridges the gap between BMAD agent development in Claude Code and real-world deployment with OpenAI. It enables agent builders to validate OpenAI API compatibility and deploy agents to end users through a simple, familiar chat interface.

**The Solution:**

A Next.js web application with three core capabilities:

1. **OpenAI Compatibility Testing:** Validates that BMAD agents built in Claude Code work properly with OpenAI's API and function calling patterns
2. **Simple Deployment:** Agent builders bundle instruction files and upload to the orchestrator - agents become immediately functional
3. **End-User Interface:** Non-technical users interact with agents through a familiar ChatGPT-style chat interface

**What Makes This Different:**

This is the **first and only platform** designed specifically for BMAD agents. There is no existing solution that:
- Understands BMAD's file-based architecture and lazy-loading instruction pattern
- Provides a simple upload-and-deploy workflow for agent builders
- Bridges Claude Code development to OpenAI deployment
- Offers lightweight, low-cost agent hosting without enterprise complexity

**Why This Will Succeed:**

The solution preserves BMAD's core philosophy of radical simplicity:
- **No translation layer:** BMAD agents use files; the platform simply enables file operations via OpenAI function calling
- **No complex configuration:** Upload files â†’ agent works
- **No infrastructure burden:** Docker deployment, file-based storage, no database overhead
- **Fills a genuine gap:** Agent builders have immediate use cases waiting for this exact solution

**Ideal User Experience:**

**For Agent Builders:**
1. Build agent in Claude Code with BMAD methodology
2. Bundle instruction files, workflows, and templates
3. Upload to Agent Orchestrator
4. Agent is immediately testable with OpenAI API
5. Share agent URL with end users for production use

**For End Users:**
- Visit agent URL
- Interact through familiar chat interface (ChatGPT/Claude.ai style)
- Agent follows instructions, reads/writes files as designed
- Simple, intuitive - no technical knowledge required
