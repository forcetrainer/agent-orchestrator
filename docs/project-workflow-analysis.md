# Project Workflow Analysis

**Date:** 2025-10-02
**Project:** Agent Orchestrator
**Analyst:** Bryan

## Assessment Results

### Project Classification

- **Project Type:** Web application (Backend service + Frontend)
- **Project Level:** Level 3 (Full Product)
- **Instruction Set:** instructions-lg.md

### Scope Summary

- **Brief Description:** Lightweight web platform enabling BMAD agent builders to test OpenAI API compatibility and deploy agents to end users. ChatGPT-style interface with file-based architecture, Docker deployment.
- **Estimated Stories:** 12-40 stories
- **Estimated Epics:** 2-5 epics
- **Timeline:** MVP: 4-8 hours; Full production-ready: TBD (personal project, flexible)

### Context

- **Greenfield/Brownfield:** Greenfield
- **Existing Documentation:** Product Brief (provided)
- **Team Size:** Solo developer (Bryan)
- **Deployment Intent:** Docker deployment for local/network access; potential future public platform

## Recommended Workflow Path

### Primary Outputs

1. **PRD (Product Requirements Document)** - Comprehensive requirements for Agent Orchestrator platform
2. **Epics Document** - High-level epic breakdown with user stories
3. **Architecture Handoff** - Technical foundation for subsequent architecture/tech spec work

### Workflow Sequence

1. ✅ Project assessment and analysis (COMPLETE)
2. → Generate PRD from product brief
3. → Generate epics and user stories
4. → Handoff to architecture/solutioning workflow (3-solutioning)

### Next Actions

1. Load instructions-lg.md for Level 3 PRD generation
2. Generate comprehensive PRD based on product brief
3. Create epics breakdown with user stories
4. Prepare handoff documentation for architecture phase

## Special Considerations

- **Primary Goal:** Validate OpenAI API compatibility with BMAD agents - this is the critical unknown
- **Radical Simplicity:** No database, no authentication (MVP), file-based architecture
- **Incremental Build:** 4-8 hour MVP with clear build sequence (1-hour POC → agent selector → file writing → file viewer)
- **Post-Architecture:** Tech spec and architecture docs will follow PRD completion

## Technical Preferences Captured

- **Frontend:** Next.js
- **Backend:** Node.js (integrated with Next.js)
- **LLM Integration:** OpenAI API with function calling
- **Storage:** File-based system (no database)
- **Deployment:** Docker containerization with volume mounts
- **Starting Point:** Repurpose existing Next.js + OpenAI chatbot template
