## What Went Well

### Process & Velocity
- **Excellent velocity:** 5 stories in 3 days for major architectural refactor
- **Clear story sequencing:** Intentionally destructive (9.1) → Simplify (9.2) → Guide (9.3) → Optimize (9.4) → Validate (9.6)
- **Self-resolved blockers:** Story 9.3 performance issue led to better Story 9.4 solution
- **Focused scope:** Stayed within workflow execution refactor boundaries

### Technical Excellence
- **Clean code removal:** 640 lines of execute_workflow deleted without breaking security
- **Security preserved:** validateWritePath, executeSaveOutput maintain path restrictions
- **Simple tool interfaces:** read_file, save_output, preload_workflow all return simple structures
- **TypeScript compilation clean:** No Epic 9-related errors introduced
- **Session management:** Correctly conversation-scoped, foundation for Phase 2

### Architecture & Design
- **LLM-orchestrated pattern:** Aligns with Claude Code proven approach
- **Smart pre-loading:** Elegant solution to rate limit problem (single tool call vs 4-6 sequential)
- **Path resolver simplification:** Removed multi-pass resolution, config auto-loading
- **System prompt guidance:** Clear orchestration instructions (v2.4.4, lines 59-204)
- **Adaptability:** Mid-epic pivot (Story 9.3 discovery → Story 9.4 enhancement) improved outcome

### Documentation
- **WORKFLOW-MIGRATION-GUIDE.md:** 570 lines, comprehensive before/after patterns
- **Migration support:** Documented removed behavior for reference
- **Troubleshooting:** Clear guidance for debugging workflow issues
- **Backlog hygiene:** Separated blocking vs post-MVP items

---

## What Could Improve

### Planning & Estimation
- **Story estimates not tracked formally:** Relied on epic-level "1-2 sprints" estimate
- **Mid-epic story changes:** Story 9.4/9.5 replacement created temporary backlog confusion
- **Performance not anticipated:** Story 9.3 rate limit issue discovered during implementation (not planning)
- **Validation incomplete:** Story 9.6 AC1 (workflow testing) and AC2 (performance benchmarking) require user interaction

### Technical Targets
- **Path resolver size deviation:** 269 lines vs 165 target (63% over, justified but missed AC)
- **Initial Story 9.4 approach:** save_output changes didn't address root cause, required pivot
- **Pre-existing technical debt:** ESLint warnings (7 errors, 2 warnings), TypeScript test errors (10) documented but not fixed

### Testing & Validation
- **No automated tests for smart pre-loading:** Story 9.4 validation manual only
- **Performance benchmarking deferred:** No empirical data on 3-5x speedup claim yet
- **Workflow validation requires user interaction:** Can't fully automate LLM behavior testing
- **Baseline metrics not captured before refactor:** Documented post-hoc

### Documentation Gaps
- **solution-architecture.md not updated:** Deferred to Epic 8
- **README.md not updated:** Deferred to Epic 8
- **Documentation scattered:** Tech spec, refactor spec, migration guide, system prompt (4 locations)

---

## Lessons Learned

### Architectural
1. **Rate limits are architectural constraints** - Must account for API quotas in workflow initialization
2. **Security code is expensive** - 127 lines for validateWritePath justified (vulnerabilities catastrophic)
3. **Simple tools + smart system prompt > complex tools with hidden logic** - LLM orchestration more transparent
4. **Smart pre-loading pattern applicable beyond workflows** - Any multi-file loading can benefit
5. **Mid-flight architecture adjustments healthy** - When based on real discovery (Story 9.3 → 9.4 pivot)

### Process
6. **Intentionally destructive stories require complete prerequisite validation** - Epic 6 must be 100% stable before Epic 9
7. **Mid-epic story changes should immediately update epic documentation** - Avoid backlog confusion
8. **Justified deviations acceptable when rationale documented** - Path resolver size (269 vs 165) clear tradeoffs
9. **Backlog hygiene matters** - HIGH (blocking) vs Medium (post-MVP) vs Low (nice-to-have) separation critical

### Testing & Validation
10. **Performance testing during implementation, not just validation** - Catches issues early (Story 9.3)
11. **Some validation requires production usage** - LLM behavior with real workflows can't be fully mocked
12. **Line count targets are guidelines** - 269 lines with docs + security > 150 lines of obscure code
13. **Baseline metrics before major refactors** - Enables empirical before/after comparison

### Documentation
14. **Documentation is a deliverable** - 570-line migration guide adds real value for maintenance
15. **Mid-epic pivots acceptable when discovery leads to better solutions** - Story 9.3 → 9.4 evolution

## Action Items from Retrospective

### Process Improvements
1. **Update epics.md when stories change mid-epic** (Owner: Sarah/Bob)
   - Status: ✅ Completed - Story 9.6 marked stories 9.4/9.5 correctly

2. **Capture baseline metrics before major refactors** (Owner: Amelia, By: Epic 10+ planning)
   - Action: Document performance/metrics before starting major refactors
   - Benefit: Enables empirical before/after validation

3. **Performance test during implementation, not just validation** (Owner: Amelia, By: All future epics)

## Epic 7 Preparation

### Dependencies on Epic 9 (All Complete ✅)
- ✅ Clean workflow architecture (execute_workflow removed)
- ✅ Simple tool set (read_file, save_output, preload_workflow)
- ✅ Volume mount paths ({bundle-root}, {core-root}, {project-root})
- ✅ Session folder structure (/data/agent-outputs/{uuid}/)
- ✅ Health check endpoint (/api/health)

### Preparation Sprint Tasks

**Critical Path (Must Complete Before Epic 7):**
1. **Fix conversation state persistence bug** (Amelia, 12-16 hours)
   - Save conversation.json to disk, restore on server restart
   - Test: Create session → restart server → verify session restored

2. **Epic 9 workflow validation** (Bryan + Amelia, 4-8 hours)
   - Run 2-3 end-to-end workflows (different bundles)
   - Execute Story 9.3 manual testing scenarios
   - Validate performance improvements (smart pre-loading <20s vs ~110s baseline)

**Epic 7 Technical Setup:**
3. **Validate health check endpoint** (Amelia, 1 hour)
4. **Create Dockerfile multi-stage build** (Amelia, 4 hours)
5. **Design docker-compose.yml with volume mounts** (Amelia/Winston, 3 hours)
6. **Document environment variables** (Sarah/Amelia, 2 hours)

**Knowledge Development:**
7. **Research Docker secrets for OPENAI_API_KEY** (Winston, 1 hour)

**Total Estimated Effort:** 30-40 hours (4-5 days)

### Critical Path Dependencies
1. Conversation persistence fix (12-16h) → Workflow validation (4-8h) → Epic 7 start
2. Manual testing (2-3h) → Workflow validation → Epic 7 start

### Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Starting Epic 7 without validating Epic 9 workflows | High | 1-2 day validation sprint before Epic 7 |
| Conversation persistence bug worse in Docker | Medium | Fix now, test with server restart scenario |
| Volume mount permissions vary by platform | Medium | Test Docker for Mac during Story 7.2 |
| OPENAI_API_KEY exposure in Docker logs | Medium | Use Docker secrets or mounted .env file |
