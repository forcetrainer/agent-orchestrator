# Engineering Backlog

This backlog collects cross-cutting or future action items that emerge from reviews and planning.

Routing guidance:

- Use this file for non-urgent optimizations, refactors, or follow-ups that span multiple stories/epics.
- Must-fix items to ship a story belong in that story's `Tasks / Subtasks`.
- Same-epic improvements may also be captured under the epic Tech Spec `Post-Review Follow-ups` section.

| Date | Story | Epic | Type | Severity | Owner | Status | Notes |
| ---- | ----- | ---- | ---- | -------- | ----- | ------ | ----- |
| **HIGH PRIORITY - ACTIVE** |
| 2025-10-12 | 9.4/9.5 | 9 | Bug | High | Dev | Open | **Conversation State Persistence & Integrated Logging**: (1) PERSISTENCE: Save conversation state to disk so it survives server restarts/hot-reloads. Current: In-memory Map clears on Next.js reload causing new sessions on every code change (Story 9.4 finding). Solution: Store conversation.json in session folder alongside manifest.json, restore from disk if not in memory. Prevents: Multiple session folders per conversation, lost conversation history, session proliferation. (2) LOGGING: Merge agent conversation with backend execution logs for debugging. Enable exporting full context (user messages + tool executions + LLM responses + timing) in unified format. Files: lib/utils/conversations.ts (add persistence), lib/sessions/chatSessions.ts (conversation storage), lib/utils/logger.ts (structured logging), components/chat/useStreamingChat.ts (export UI), app/api/chat/route.ts (conversation restoration). Estimated effort: 12-16 hours. Benefit: Fix session proliferation bug, enable powerful debugging workflow. Priority: HIGH (fixes active bug). |
| 2025-10-12 | 9.3 | 9 | Testing | High | Dev | Open | Execute manual testing scenarios for AC5 validation with live LLM - test workflow execution flow, config/path variable resolution, error recovery. BLOCKING: Must complete before marking Story 9.3 as "Done". Test scenarios in Dev Notes lines 260-309. (AC #5) |
| 2025-10-06 | 5.0 | 5 | Bug | Medium | TBD | Open | Connect workflow finalization hook to call finalizeSession() on workflow completion. Manifests may remain in "running" status. File: lib/agents/sessionDiscovery.ts:206 (AC 5.0.3) |
| 2025-10-05 | 4.8 | 4 | Bug | Medium | TBD | Open | getAgentById() calls discoverBundles() on every invocation causing redundant bundle scans during chat. Implement caching mechanism. File: lib/agents/loader.ts:146 |
| 2025-10-08 | 6.6 | 6 | Bug | Medium | Frontend/UX | Open | Fix drag-select behavior across UI. Problem: When dragging files from DirectoryTree, text selection occurs in other UI areas (message content, buttons, agent selector). Expected: (1) Dragging files from tree should not cause text selection anywhere, (2) Normal text selection should still work when not dragging files, (3) Text selection in other areas should be limited to actual text content (not UI controls). Files: components/DirectoryTree.tsx. Attempted solutions that didn't work: CSS user-select on tree container, global dragging-file body class. Need: Better DnD event handling or selective user-select CSS strategy. |
| 2025-10-10 | 8.1 | 8 | Enhancement | Medium | Frontend/UX | Open | Fix streaming buffer flush at end of response. Problem: Character-by-character streaming works smoothly (100 chars/sec), but when API sends [DONE], remaining buffer content dumps instantly creating jarring "pop-in" effect. Files: components/chat/useStreamingChat.ts:351-360. Root cause: Tension between (1) keeping streaming indicator on until buffer empty vs (2) useEffect clearing streamingContent 100ms after isStreaming=false. Need: Better coordination between buffer draining, streaming state, and content cleanup. Estimated effort: 3-4 hours. Benefit: Professional streaming UX matching Claude.ai quality. |
| **MEDIUM PRIORITY - EPIC 9** |
| 2025-10-12 | 9.3 | 9 | TechDebt | Low | Dev | Open | Clarify Step 3 timing emphasis in system-prompt.md:110 - rephrase "before executing any workflow" to "before executing workflow instructions (Step 4)" for precision. File: lib/agents/prompts/system-prompt.md:110 (AC #6, Finding 4) |
| 2025-10-12 | 9.3 | 9 | Documentation | Low | Dev | Open | Update tech-spec-epic-9.md:930 with actual line count (146) as accepted deviation (justified for AC4 examples and AC6 clarity). Effort: 2 minutes. File: docs/tech-spec-epic-9.md:930 (AC #2, Finding 3) |
| 2025-10-12 | 9.2 | 9 | TechDebt | Low | Dev | Open | Update JSDoc in fileOperations.ts to remove stale bundleConfig parameter references. Files: lib/tools/fileOperations.ts:41, 62, 122. Impact: Minor documentation inconsistency, doesn't affect functionality. Effort: 5 minutes. |
| 2025-10-12 | 9.2 | 9 | TechDebt | Low | Dev | Open | Add clarifying docstring to nested variable test explaining single-pass design decision. File: lib/__tests__/pathResolver.test.ts:102-120. Clarify that literal `{bundle-root}` in output is expected (single-pass design, not bug). Effort: 5 minutes. |
| 2025-10-12 | 9.2 | 9 | Bug | Low | Infrastructure | Open | Document Google Fonts build issue - font loading requires network access during build. Consider fallback or local font hosting. File: app/layout.tsx. Investigation effort: 30 minutes. |
| 2025-10-12 | 9.2 | 9 | TechDebt | Low | Dev | Open | Address pre-existing ESLint warnings: React unescaped entities, missing hook dependencies. Files: app/overview/page.tsx, components/FileViewerPanel.tsx, components/chat/useStreamingChat.ts. Not introduced by Story 9.2. Effort: 1-2 hours. |
| **MEDIUM PRIORITY - POST-MVP ENHANCEMENTS** |
| 2025-10-06 | 5.0 | 5 | TechDebt | Medium | TBD | Post-MVP | Add formal unit test suite for session discovery (lib/agents/__tests__/sessionDiscovery.test.ts) and path security (lib/__tests__/pathResolver.security.test.ts). Currently only smoke tests exist. (AC 5.0.6, 5.0.7) |
| 2025-10-07 | 5.2.1 | 5 | Enhancement | Medium | Frontend | Post-MVP | Consider timezone-aware timestamp formatting based on user locale. Current: hardcoded UTC. Suggested: Intl.DateTimeFormat with user's timezone or config. File: lib/files/manifestReader.ts:138 |
| 2025-10-07 | 5.2.1 | 5 | TechDebt | Medium | Product + Frontend | Post-MVP | Complete Task 5: Dedicated metadata panel UI when UX design finalized. Current: metadata attached, UUID in title tooltip. Blocked by: UX design requirements. |
| 2025-10-08 | 6.3 | 6 | Feature | Medium | Frontend/UX | Post-MVP | Implement dark mode for entire application. Markdown rendering specification (docs/markdown-rendering-spec.md) includes both light and dark mode styles. Dark mode should: (1) Add theme toggle UI control, (2) Implement dark mode color scheme app-wide, (3) Use dark mode markdown spec for file viewer, (4) Persist user preference (localStorage or config), (5) Respect system preference (prefers-color-scheme). Estimated effort: 8-12 hours. Benefit: Improved accessibility and user preference support. |
| **LOW PRIORITY - FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS** |
| 2025-10-05 | 4.9 | 4 | Enhancement | Low | TBD | Post-MVP | Command descriptions show workflow file paths (e.g., "loads: workflows/intake-itsm/workflow.yaml") - exposes internal details. Remove or make configurable. File: lib/agents/systemPromptBuilder.ts:100-111 |
| 2025-10-05 | 4.9 | 4 | TechDebt | Medium | TBD | Post-MVP | Verify workflow file writing operations work correctly and follow BMAD patterns. Test template-based workflows, path resolution. File: lib/tools/fileOperations.ts (executeSaveOutput) |
| 2025-10-05 | 4.6 | 4 | Tech Debt | Low | TBD | Post-MVP | Add JSDoc documentation for bundle metadata flow - types/api.ts, AgentSelector.tsx, ChatPanel.tsx |
| 2025-10-05 | 4.6 | 4 | Tech Debt | Low | TBD | Post-MVP | Review InitializeRequest bundle params usage - app/api/agent/initialize/route.ts:15-19. Document or implement in Story 4.7 |
| 2025-10-05 | 4.6 | 4 | Enhancement | Low | TBD | Post-MVP | Enhance empty state message with developer guidance - AgentSelector.tsx:145-148. Link to BUNDLE-SPEC.md |
| 2025-10-05 | 4.12 | 4 | TechDebt | Low | TBD | Post-MVP | Validate internal markdown links (e.g., #3-agentic-execution-loop) resolve correctly in GitHub renderer and other common viewers. Files: README.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, TROUBLESHOOTING.md |
| 2025-10-05 | 4.12 | 4 | TechDebt | Low | TBD | Post-MVP | Replace user-specific path `/Users/bryan/agent-orchestrator/` with `{project-root}` placeholder in examples. File: ARCHITECTURE.md:517 |
| 2025-10-05 | 4.12 | 4 | TechDebt | Low | TBD | Post-MVP | Add language tags to remaining code blocks for consistent syntax highlighting (e.g., ```bash, ```typescript). File: TROUBLESHOOTING.md |
| 2025-10-06 | 5.0 | 5 | Enhancement | Low | TBD | Post-MVP | Validate concurrent write safety for registerOutput() - add stress test with 10+ simultaneous writes. Consider file locking if race conditions found. File: lib/agents/sessionDiscovery.ts:163 (AC 5.0.7) |
| 2025-10-06 | 5.0 | 5 | Enhancement | Low | TBD | Post-MVP | Add integration test for cross-agent discovery (Alex → Casey → Pixel workflow chain). Verify related_sessions linking works correctly. (AC 5.0.6) |
| 2025-10-07 | 5.2.1 | 5 | Enhancement | Low | Frontend | Post-MVP | Add test for very long agent titles/workflow names (>100 chars) to verify CSS truncation. File: components/__tests__/DirectoryTree.test.tsx. Effort: 15min. |
| 2025-10-07 | 5.2.1 | 5 | Documentation | Low | TBD | Post-MVP | Add ADR documenting decision to defer Task 5 metadata panel. Rationale: metadata attached, no UX design, not blocking. Location: docs/adrs/adr-005-session-metadata-display.md |
| 2025-10-07 | 5.3 | 5 | Enhancement | Low | TBD | Post-MVP | Add structured logging library (pino/winston) to replace console.error() in API routes for better observability. Files: app/api/files/content/route.ts:131, 259. Effort: 2-4 hours. Benefit: Log aggregation support, configurable log levels. |
| 2025-10-07 | 5.3 | 5 | Enhancement | Low | TBD | Post-MVP | Make file size thresholds configurable (extract 1MB truncation threshold and 5000-line limit to env vars). Files: app/api/files/content/route.ts:69, 234; lib/utils/env.ts. Effort: 1 hour. Benefit: Easier production tuning. |
| 2025-10-07 | 5.3 | 5 | Enhancement | Low | TBD | Post-MVP | Add E2E test for full user flow: click tree node → API call → content display (Playwright/Cypress). Effort: 2-3 hours. Benefit: Additional integration confidence (current unit/integration tests already provide strong coverage). |
| 2025-10-07 | 5.3 | 5 | Enhancement | Low | Frontend/UX | Post-MVP | UI design improvements for file viewer (styling, visual polish, layout refinements). Functional requirements met; defer visual enhancements to post-MVP refinement phase. Includes making the viewer more dynamic (ability to resize panels, hide panels, etc.). Files: components/FileViewerPanel.tsx, components/FileContentDisplay.tsx |
| 2025-10-09 | 6.9 | 6 | Enhancement | Low | Frontend/UX | Post-MVP | Implement word-boundary buffering for streaming tokens. Problem: Raw token streaming shows incomplete words (e.g., "Execut" → "Executing") which can look jarring. Solution: Accumulate tokens until complete word detected (space/punctuation), then display. Trade-offs: (1) Cleaner reading experience, (2) Slight latency ~50-100ms before text appears, (3) More complex buffering logic. Files: components/chat/useStreamingChat.ts. Estimated effort: 2-3 hours. Benefit: Smoother streaming UX, reduces user confusion from partial tokens. Note: Current raw token streaming is industry-standard behavior (ChatGPT, Claude.ai). |
| **LOW PRIORITY - STORY 10.0 REVIEW** |
| 2025-10-12 | 10.0 | 10 | Enhancement | Low | TBD | Open | **[AI-Review][Low] Add Type Documentation for browserId**: PersistedConversation.browserId is string | null but tech spec shows string. Add JSDoc explaining null during migration phase, set by Story 10.2. File: types/index.ts:145 (AC2) |
| 2025-10-12 | 10.0 | 10 | Documentation | Low | TBD | Open | **[AI-Review][Low] Clarify Test Results in Story**: AC7 states "all tests pass" but 17 test suites failed (unrelated to Story 10.0). Update completion notes to specify: "Story 10.0 security tests: 30/30 passing". File: docs/stories/story-10.0.md (AC7) |
| **RESOLVED** |
| 2025-10-06 | 5.0 | 5 | Bug | High | Bryan | Resolved | ✅ Agent metadata extraction from workflow author field implemented. Manifests now correctly show agent name, title, and bundle. File: lib/tools/fileOperations.ts:230-231 (AC 5.0.3) |
| 2025-10-12 | 9.3 | 9 | TechDebt | Medium | Dev | Resolved | ✅ Resolved `{{SESSION_FOLDER}}` placeholder contradiction - clarified agent-managed vs workflow-orchestrated sessions. File: lib/agents/prompts/system-prompt.md:48-50 (AC #6, Finding 1) |
| 2025-10-12 | 9.3 | 9 | Enhancement | Medium | Dev | Resolved | ✅ Added Error Handling section after Variable Resolution Rules with read_file, YAML parsing, and save_output error recovery patterns. File: lib/agents/prompts/system-prompt.md:206-230 (AC #6, Finding 2) |
