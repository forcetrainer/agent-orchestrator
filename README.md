# Agent Orchestrator

A Next.js-based platform that enables BMAD agent builders to validate OpenAI API compatibility and deploy agents to end users through an intuitive chat interface.

## Overview

**Agent Orchestrator** bridges the gap between agent development in Claude Code and production deployment for non-technical users. It provides a platform designed specifically for BMAD agents, enabling file-based agents with lazy-loading instruction patterns to work seamlessly with OpenAI's function calling API.

### The Problem It Solves

Agent builders can create sophisticated BMAD agents in Claude Code, but these agents are trapped in the IDE with no way to:
- Test OpenAI API compatibility before deployment
- Make agents accessible to non-technical end users
- Validate that file-based agent patterns work with OpenAI function calling
- Share working agents for stakeholder feedback and real-world use

### The Solution

Agent Orchestrator provides three core capabilities:

1. **OpenAI Compatibility Testing** - Validates that BMAD agents built in Claude Code function correctly with OpenAI's API and function calling patterns
2. **Simple Deployment** - Agent builders upload instruction files and agents become immediately functional
3. **End-User Interface** - Non-technical users interact with agents through a familiar ChatGPT-style chat interface

## Key Features

- **Agentic Execution Loop** - Claude Code-like agent execution pattern using OpenAI's function calling API with pause-load-continue pattern
- **Lazy File Loading** - Resources loaded on-demand during execution for optimal performance and scalability
- **Path Variable Resolution** - Portable bundle structure with dynamic path resolution (`{bundle-root}`, `{core-root}`, `{project-root}`)
- **Critical Actions Processor** - Agent initialization with minimal required files
- **Bundle System** - Self-contained agent packages with workflows, templates, and configurations

## Architecture

Agent Orchestrator implements a **Claude Code-like agent execution pattern** using OpenAI's function calling API. The architecture enables lazy loading of files and workflows through an agentic execution loop.

### Core Components

#### 1. Agentic Execution Loop (`lib/agents/agenticLoop.ts`)
- Implements pause-load-continue pattern
- Handles tool calls from LLM to load resources on-demand
- Iterates until task completion with safety limits
- See: [AGENT-EXECUTION-SPEC.md](docs/AGENT-EXECUTION-SPEC.md#3-agentic-execution-loop)

#### 2. Path Resolution System (`lib/pathResolver.ts`)
- Resolves path variables: `{bundle-root}`, `{core-root}`, `{project-root}`
- Supports config references: `{config_source}:variable_name`
- Security validation prevents path traversal
- See: [AGENT-EXECUTION-SPEC.md](docs/AGENT-EXECUTION-SPEC.md#5-path-resolution-system)

#### 3. Critical Actions Processor (`lib/agents/criticalActions.ts`)
- Executes initialization sequence when agent loads
- Loads minimal required files (typically just config.yaml)
- Injects loaded content into initial context
- See: [AGENT-EXECUTION-SPEC.md](docs/AGENT-EXECUTION-SPEC.md#4-critical-actions-processor)

#### 4. Bundle System
- Self-contained agent packages with workflows and templates
- Located in `bmad/custom/bundles/{bundle-name}/`
- Contains: agents/, workflows/, templates/, config.yaml, bundle.yaml
- See: [BUNDLE-SPEC.md](docs/BUNDLE-SPEC.md)

### Execution Flow

```
User message
  â†’ LLM generates tool call (read_file/execute_workflow)
  â†’ Execution pauses
  â†’ Tool executes, file content loaded
  â†’ Result injected into context
  â†’ LLM continues with loaded content
  â†’ Final response
```

### Key Benefits

- **Lazy Loading**: Only loads files when explicitly needed via tool calls
- **Scalability**: Agents can have 10+ workflows without pre-loading all of them
- **Performance**: Fast initialization, lower context window usage
- **Efficiency**: Resources loaded on-demand during execution

## Development

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm test

# Watch mode
npm run test:watch
```

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

### Development Guidelines

- All business logic in `/lib` should be framework-agnostic (no Next.js/React dependencies)
- Components are organized by feature area, not by component type
- Use index files for clean imports: `@/lib/utils` and `@/types`
- Tests are located in `__tests__` directories alongside source code
- Follow Next.js 14 App Router conventions

### Working with Agents

**Adding New Tools:**
- Update tool definitions in `lib/tools/` and system prompt builder

**Creating Bundles:**
- Follow BUNDLE-SPEC.md structure
- Validate paths using path variable system
- Include bundle.yaml manifest and config.yaml

**Debugging Agent Execution:**
- Check logs for tool calls and path resolution
- Use test bundles in `bmad/custom/bundles/test-bundle/`
