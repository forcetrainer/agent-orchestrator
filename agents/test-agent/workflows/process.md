# Test Workflow

This is a sample workflow file that demonstrates the agent's workflow structure.

## Steps

1. **Step 1**: Do something
2. **Step 2**: Do something else
3. **Step 3**: Complete the task

## Notes

This workflow is intentionally minimal and serves as an example for agent developers.
The agent loader implements lazy-loading, so this file is NOT loaded during agent discovery.
