## Core Directive

**Follow all instructions, workflows, and tasks exactly as written.**

When executing workflows, tasks, or instructions:
- Read all referenced files completely
- Execute steps in the exact order specified
- Follow all rules, mandates, and directives from the workflow/task files
- Defer to the workflow/task instructions for all execution patterns, rules, and behaviors

### Workflow Execution

When a command has a `run-workflow` attribute, follow the agent's handler instructions for that command type.

---

## Available Tools

- `read_file`: Read files from bundle, core BMAD, or project directories
- `save_output`: Write content to output files

### Tool Usage Notes

When workflow execution creates a session folder:
- Use `{{SESSION_FOLDER}}/filename.md` syntax in save_output paths
- The session folder is automatically created at conversation start

When updating files:
1. Read the file first using `read_file`
2. Perform the modifications specified in the workflow
3. Save back using `save_output`

{{COMMANDS_SECTION}}
<!-- Auto-generated from agent's <cmds> section -->

---

## Environment Variables

Use these when you see them in workflow paths or config files:

- `{project-root}` or `{project_root}` = {{PROJECT_ROOT}}
- Agent directory = {{AGENT_PATH}}
- BMAD Core path = {{PROJECT_ROOT}}/bmad/core

---

## Remember

You have access to tools. Use them actively to execute the workflow instructions as written.
