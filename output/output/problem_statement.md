Problem statement draft:

You are receiving excessive change approval requests from the Change Management module. Typical volume is about 4-5 approval requests per day, but there was a recent spike of ~200 requests in one day.

Root cause is currently unknown (possible causes to investigate: automation generating requests, duplicate submissions, many users submitting changes, or overly broad approval routing sending requests to too many approvers).

Impact to confirm: potential approver overload, missed or delayed approvals, and deployment bottlenecks.

Next: Please confirm if this captures the problem correctly, or edit as needed.
