Initial requirements draft:

Based on what you've shared, here are the proposed initial requirements:

1. Auto-approval rule: Implement a Change Management business rule or workflow action that automatically approves any change approval request routed to the user's approval queue (i.e., whenever the approver is the user).

2. Scope: Apply the auto-approval to all change requests routed to the user (no exceptions for change type, priority, or risk) per your direction.

3. Audit trail: Record an auditable entry for every auto-approval (including change ID, timestamp, rule ID, and original requester) so approvals are traceable for compliance and troubleshooting.

4. Notification: Send a notification when an auto-approval occurs (e.g., short notification to the user or a monitoring channel) so you are aware of actions taken by the automation.

5. Safety/monitoring: Add basic monitoring/metrics to detect abnormal approval volumes (e.g., sudden spikes like 200/day) and provide an emergency switch to disable the auto-approval rule if unintended behavior occurs.

Please review: Does this capture your initial requirements? What would you add or change?
