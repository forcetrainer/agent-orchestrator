## Problem Statement
You are receiving excessive change approval requests from the Change Management module. Typical volume is about 4-5 approval requests per day, but there was a recent spike of ~200 requests in one day.

Root cause is currently unknown (possible causes to investigate: automation generating requests, duplicate submissions, many users submitting changes, or overly broad approval routing sending requests to too many approvers).

Impact to confirm: potential approver overload, missed or delayed approvals, and deployment bottlenecks.

## Business Impact
**Value/ROI:** Expected ROI: save about $2,000/day in lost time.

**Impact if not solved:** I'll keep wasting my time.

## How It Should Work
Automatically approve every change request routed to you (the user). There are no exceptions â€” these are automated changes and should be auto-approved without manual intervention.

## Initial Requirements
Initial requirements draft:

Based on what you've shared, here are the proposed initial requirements:

1. Auto-approval rule: Implement a Change Management business rule or workflow action that automatically approves any change approval request routed to the user's approval queue (i.e., whenever the approver is the user).

2. Scope: Apply the auto-approval to all change requests routed to the user (no exceptions for change type, priority, or risk) per your direction.

3. Audit trail: Record an auditable entry for every auto-approval (including change ID, timestamp, rule ID, and original requester) so approvals are traceable for compliance and troubleshooting.

4. Notification: Send a notification when an auto-approval occurs (e.g., short notification to the user or a monitoring channel) so you are aware of actions taken by the automation.

5. Safety/monitoring: Add basic monitoring/metrics to detect abnormal approval volumes (e.g., sudden spikes like 200/day) and provide an emergency switch to disable the auto-approval rule if unintended behavior occurs.

Please review: Does this capture your initial requirements? What would you add or change?
