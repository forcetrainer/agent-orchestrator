<step n="3" goal="Validate logical ordering and dependencies">
<action>Analyze story numbering and dependencies</action>

**Dependency Analysis:**

For each story:
1. **Extract declared dependencies** from Dependencies section
2. **Identify implicit dependencies** from story content:
   - Does story require data model from another story?
   - Does story depend on configuration from another story?
   - Does story build on functionality from another story?
   - Does story reference fields/rules/integrations from another story?

3. **Validate dependency ordering:**
   - Story X depends on Story Y ‚Üí Y must have lower number than X
   - Flag circular dependencies (Story A depends on B, B depends on A)
   - Flag forward dependencies (Story 2 depends on Story 5)

4. **Identify missing dependencies:**
   - Story should have dependency but doesn't list it
   - Story has technical prerequisite not documented

**üîó Dependency Analysis**

**Dependency Map:**
```
Story 1 (Foundation)
  ‚Üì required by Story 2, Story 3

Story 2 (Core Feature)
  ‚Üì required by Story 4
  ‚ö†Ô∏è VIOLATION: Also depends on Story 3 (later story)

Story 3 (Configuration)
  ‚Üì required by Story 2, Story 5

Story 4 (Integration)
  ‚Üì No downstream dependencies

Story 5 (Enhancement)
  ‚ö†Ô∏è VIOLATION: Depends on Story 7 (not yet created)
```

**‚ùå Ordering Violations Detected: {{violation_count}}**

**Violation 1:** Story {{story_x}} depends on Story {{story_y}}
- **Problem:** Story {{story_y}} comes AFTER Story {{story_x}} ({{story_y}} > {{story_x}})
- **Impact:** Story {{story_x}} cannot be implemented until Story {{story_y}} is complete
- **Recommendation:**
  a) Renumber: Story {{story_y}} ‚Üí Story {{new_number_y}}, Story {{story_x}} ‚Üí Story {{new_number_x}}
  b) Remove dependency and make Story {{story_x}} independent
  c) Split Story {{story_x}} into two stories

**Violation 2:** Circular dependency detected
- **Problem:** Story {{story_a}} depends on Story {{story_b}}, but Story {{story_b}} also depends on Story {{story_a}}
- **Impact:** Neither story can be started without the other
- **Recommendation:**
  a) Create Story {{story_a}}.5 with shared foundation
  b) Refactor to remove circular dependency
  c) Merge into single story

[Continue for all violations...]

**‚ö†Ô∏è Missing Dependencies Detected: {{missing_count}}**

**Missing 1:** Story {{story_n}} uses fields from Story {{story_m}} but doesn't list dependency
- **Evidence:** Story {{story_n}} references {{field_name}} created in Story {{story_m}}
- **Recommendation:** Add "Depends on Story {{story_m}}" to Story {{story_n}}

<step n="4" goal="Verify requirements coverage">

**Requirements Coverage Analysis:**

1. **Extract all requirements from requirements document:**
   - Functional requirements
   - Technical requirements
   - UI/UX requirements
   - Integration requirements
   - Security requirements
   - Performance requirements

2. **Map requirements to stories:**
   - Which story(ies) address each requirement?
   - Are any requirements not covered by any story?
   - Are any requirements covered by multiple stories (potential duplication)?

3. **Check for scope creep:**
   - Are there stories that don't trace back to requirements?
   - Have stories added functionality not in requirements?

4. **Validate completeness:**
   - Are all requirements fully addressed?
   - Are requirements only partially implemented?

**Story Sizing Validation:**

1. **Check story point consistency:**
   - Are similar stories sized similarly?
   - Are story points appropriate for scope?
   - Are any stories too large (>13 points)?

2. **Validate sprint capacity:**
   - Total story points: {{total_points}}
   - Typical sprint capacity: {{sprint_capacity}} points
   - Number of sprints needed: {{sprints_needed}}

3. **Identify unbalanced stories:**
   - Stories that should be split
   - Stories that could be combined

**üìè Story Sizing Analysis**

**Total Epic Points:** {{total_points}}
**Estimated Sprints:** {{sprints_needed}} (assuming {{sprint_capacity}} points/sprint)

**Oversized Stories (>13 points):**
- Story {{story_x}}: {{points_x}} points - **TOO LARGE**
  - Recommendation: Split into Story {{story_x}}.1 and Story {{story_x}}.2

**Undersized Stories (<2 points):**
- Story {{story_y}}: {{points_y}} point - **TOO SMALL**
  - Recommendation: Combine with Story {{story_z}}

**Sizing Inconsistencies:**
- Story {{story_a}} ({{points_a}} points) has more FRs than Story {{story_b}} ({{points_b}} points)
  - Review: Should Story {{story_a}} be higher or Story {{story_b}} be lower?

<step n="6" goal="Perform ServiceNow platform validation">
<action>Review stories for ServiceNow-specific considerations</action>

**Platform Validation Checks:**

1. **Table/Field Naming:**
   - Are table names valid ServiceNow naming conventions?
   - Are field names following best practices?
   - Are custom tables properly prefixed?

2. **Technical Feasibility:**
   - Can requirements be implemented in ServiceNow?
   - Are there platform limitations to consider?
   - Are integrations using standard ServiceNow patterns?

3. **Best Practices:**
   - Are business rules over-used (performance)?
   - Are UI policies preferred over client scripts?
   - Are ACLs properly defined?

4. **Technical Debt Considerations:**
   - Are there maintenance implications?
   - Are there upgrade considerations?
   - Are customizations minimal and necessary?
